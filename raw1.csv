1,My phone has the GlueGate issue...I can see the Green color light on the sides of the display.@huawei : What should I do?,0
5,"Call Quality: No issues whatsoever.Battery Backup: Solid 6.5 to 7 hours of screen on timeSize of the phone: Despite the screen size of ~6.4inches, the phone feels compact and well builtCamera: I own a Pixel with latest camera set up. In daylight, Mate 20 pro's superior hardware gather excellent details. In night mode, Mate 20 pro outputs pic which are sharp leading to more details. Pixel night mode outputs pictures which are soft, has more light and less noise. Its a personal preference, but Pixel is marginally better in software processing, however Mate 20 pro pics are totally worth it. It is 9.5 to Mate 20 pro to 10 to Pixel for night mode alone. Daylight pictures, Mate 20 pro is better than Pixel for details.Kirin 980: Beats 845 easilyFast Charger: You can literally see the difference and this is ONE OF THE BIGGEST + point of Mate 20 proUI: EMUI is a pain, however there are numerous launchers (Microsoft launcher, Pix launcher, Poco launcher, etc) in playstore that makes the user experience pleasant.Overall: No phone comes close to beating Mate 20 pro.",1
5,"This is an amazing piece of hardware you'll be using.. Initially, I waited for the pixel3xl but it was having a horrible design and a terrifying price! Later heard about Mare 20 pro and decided to wait for that. bought it on the launch day itself.. Received the product in three days as promised by Amazon. Wanted the 'emerald green' color but was not available to purchase. Didn't want to wait again.As an iPhone user for nearly 5 years and Samsung user for last one year, I can clearly see the difference in quality! When I bought the Samsung galaxy s8, I was not at all impressed. Did not like its speed and performance{even though it's directly out of box}.Huawei Mate 20 Pro is clearly a beast. The hardware is really good.I thought twilight might be girlish, but it's not. It's really good. But a fingerprint magnet. So I decided to go for Matte sticker on the back body {check the second Image}.Haven't decided whether I should stick the Matte finish on the screen. Worried if the fingerprint sensor would work well or not!The EMUI 9 is not bad, but not great. A lot of things I used in the Samsung UI is missing{like 'secure folder' and a few other apps} and also some other features. They should allow us to customize the 'Always on Display' just like in Samsung. Hope it'll come in the coming updates.The InScreen fingerprint is really good. The face recognition is damn fast but does not work in pitch black(It works very well in LOW LIGHT though). That's when the fingerprint comes in handy.The reverse charging works pretty well but don't expect it to be fast.The 40w adaptor works magic.The display is really good. The 2K+ screen is eye-catching. colors are vivid.Overall its a great phone with great features.Loved the pre-order offer. Sennheiser PXC550 works very well. Although I already owned the Sony WH1000XM2 I had to sell the Sennheiser to my friend. A great Buy. I would say its a 'bang for buck' buy. Don't think twice.",1
1,"I am attaching a pic of 2 mate 20 pro side by side.On left is my phone and on right a second mate 20 pro also purchased on amazon.Both are on same brightness and are displaying same image. Left one clearly shows signs of discoloration on screen.Have requested amazon for a replacement, that is pending a verification from their engineer.okay got confirmed that screen issue but amazon cannot replace but wants to refund only 45000/= its a big jokepoor product , poor #huaweimate20pro , poor Amazon india.Edit got a replacement product From AMAZON.",0
5,Okay...so I had plans to buy pixel 3 or 3XL initially..because I really like phones with a decent camera...but I had to ignore that idea ..because  it was a but too expensive..then as time went by..I started scrolling through YouTube..and got introduced to the mate 20 pro..and I must say I was impressed...and since I have used nexus 6p (which was manufactured by Huawei) I had an idea of Huawei phones..So far I have used this phone for about a week...and below are my opinions about the phone..Pro1. Camera: This phone clicks amazing pictures ....you have a lot of options as well .the wide angle lens..night mode..aperture mode.portrait...and you should try the night mode...it's an absolute beast...though I wish it was a bit more responsive (coz it takes 3-5 secs to get a picture clicked in night mode)..not really very impressed with the selfie camera though..2. Battery : I am a heavy user as far as usage is concerned ...and boy oh boy..this phone can last for a day (with heavy usage) and around a day and half for an average user.3. Processer : I must say that I am very impressed with the hardware of the phone...Kirin 980 impresses ...and scrolling down and multi tasking in this phone is buttery smooth...4. Build Quality : The phone looks premium and you need to check this yourself to agree to this point..Screen is decent .notch is wide..but well placed ..5. Flexibility: Like every android phone..you can modify the phone as per your convenience.it will take a couple of days for you to understand the interface..but trust me..it will get better with time..To be honest..most of Huawei apps are ignorable..except phone cloning...which is a blessing..trust me..you won't loose an iota of your data from your previous phones..Cons1.EMUI needs an update..I hope they update the OS soon..coz it looks a bit primitive...specially when you start off the phone in factory  mode..2. Night mode needs to be a bit more responsive. I didn't like the 3-5 sec delay.3. Very average video camera..specially in dark settings.i think they will tweak the camera settings soon and improve it as time goes byThe cherry on top was the bundle offer with pxc 550..if you get that offer...buy it ..before thinking twice..coz you get a premium Bluetooth headset (arnd30k) for just 2k extra money. I have given an extra star for that..coz that deal is an absolute stealer..Last but not the least..kudos to the Amazon delivery team..I got the phone the next day itself..They are doing an amazing job.,0
1,"Pls kindly don't buy this phone if you are looking for a smoother experience like Oneplus, Apple or Pixel....Performance of this phone is pathetic....Extremely Laggy UI....Only Good part is the Night Mode in this Camera....Even after several tests I got an Antutu score of 225000. Even Samsung is way better than this phone. Pls buy any other phone if you are looking for a buttery smooth performance. Fingerprint scanner is useless.....",1
5,"1. Beautiful looks... slim design..love to hold...Blazing fast performance thanks to kirin 980 7nm very fast chipset....it is more fast than Snapdragon 845....Innovative hardware....2. Network connectivity superb...3. Curved Display looks gorgeous... watching movie and you tube videos on it its superb Experience...Gorgeous Amoled HDR display.4. Loud speaker well enough to hear the ringtones as well as music...type c earphones works well...5. Indisplay fingerprint scanner quite fast but face recognition is super fast.6. Battery 4200 mah is mind blowing... Super fast charging in 30 min 70 percent charge...heavy usage 1 day battery stays and average usage min.. 2 day battery stays with the phone....great battery life7. Camera is Amazing... dslr like images comes out... portrait... low light... AI feature...ultra wide angle camera is fantastic... Brilliant photos comes out...Huawei has really done its bit to push forward mobile photography. it's taken a number of years but the high profile partnership between the company and German optics brand Leica seems to finally be producing immersive results. One of the best smartphone camera out there as well as favourite phone of 2018, it should no surprise that the Mate 20 Pro once again impress with its photography skills.All rounder phone with beauty and brain...loved it... The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is a phone that you'll simply fall in love with.",1

5,I am so happy to write this review...First of all thank you so much amazon for giving such an amazing deal on this phone...I received my sennheiser headphones a day earlier than the phone and was totally impressed with them...It made me feel like I have already got the bang for my bucks on this phone...And today I received the phone and man....This phone is just so good....It is damn snappy and has amazing display....It is both .. beauty outside and beast inside....Loved it....Thanks amazon for the phone....Highly recommended to anyone who wants all the features in one phone....,0
5,"This is mind-blowing in every way. In previous I was used I phn x, nokia 8 sirroco and also Samsungs S model phone but the features provide by Huawei is amazing and the speed of the phnis fantastic, no one can beat this phn also I phone xs & 3xl. From Battery to camera the phone called BOSS OF 2018.",1
4,"Wow.. First of all I was skeptical about investing so much money.. Then I said, screw it and went for it. Totally not disappointed brothers. Here are my 2 cents.Pros:Best pro: ip68 water proof. I took it into the water stream and all my friends were surprised. Too much fun.1. Kirin processor 980..the 7nm chipset definitely is faster than my sd 845 mobile. I hv a mi mix 2s. Also consumes less power, hence long lasting.2. Best in class gpu. You can play all high end games with out any lag.3. Main feature is the camera. I think the attached pics will say it all.4. Bundled Software: huawei health, hi vision are too helpful. I m still getting used to EMUI.5. OLED screen. Boy this is so cool to look at. Mid day sunlight and still it is bright af. Cript 4k videos as well. Loved it.6. Super fast charging. 36 minutes from 0 to 100 when screen is off).7. Dual 4g support. Yep I can my idea as default isp and still use jio.8. List can go on, but i m bound with number of letters.Cons:1. Sound port: it is same as the charging port. So if the phine is on charging, sound gets muffled.2. Emui needs update to reach to ""switch mobile network"". Now i need to navigate inside settings to change that.3. Notch design. I fking hate it. Phone has the ability to omit that, but still I m losing some precious screen space.4. Not really a con, but 3.5 mm jack is missing.I hope this will help you decide the right phone for you. Peace.",1
5,"I've been using this one for the past three days. Starting with the battery life its amazing. Whether you do gaming, watch Netflix it easily lasts for 6-8 hours. And on normal usage browsing and music it can easily get you by the day. Charging is super fast. It gains 1% every few seconds while charging. Display is amazing. Colours are very vibrant and punchy. Switching between apps. Opening and closing them is lightning fast. No lag at all no matter how many you pop open and close. Phone almost never heats up during usage. Though it gets a bit warm during extended camera usage. I'm talking about couple of mins here which indeed needs improvement. Camera is super fast at clicking, focusing and switching between modes as well. Camera's artificial intelligence is amazing as it easily selects the best mode depending on the scene to be clicked. 40 megapixel primary rear lens is a beast at producing some high resolution pics. Zooming is not allowed on this lens. So that's a bummer. Front 24 megapixel produces some good portraits as well. But the front camera needs a bit of an improvement. Hope they do this through software updates. Rear camera setup is amazing. Easily goes on par if not beyond pixel 3's capabilities. NIGHT MODE is really something on this device. But I would say not recommend for moving objects. But when the object of focus stays steady for 4 seconds then you see some miracles captured on your device. They are quite a few interesting filters and I guess more will be added to camera interface in the near future. Face unlock works like a charm even in darker environments. Finger print sensor needs a bit of an improvement. Works 7/10 times which needs to be fixed in future updates as well. On the whole this is the first Huawei phone I'm using and I can say that it easily outclasses other premium competitors. Hope to provide you with more information again after one month.",1
1,Recieved a faulty set with green line of death on the display.. Waiting for refund.,0
4,Everything seeme ok but phone back glass is very slippery and seems they delivered to me thier previous generation one and not the one new generation where it is mentioned like they  overcome this by doing some changes.Some times phone performance is super but it suddenly lag at certain point and this was not the case of my previous one plus 3 Will add m,0
5,"Super fast and smooth....Design is appealing......Awesome battery.....Super display with good sunlight legibility......Its a breeze to set up.....Call clarity and data reception up there with the best.....Fingerprint sensor can be improved....Feel that this is the one function that does not match all the others....Storage adequate however the NM card is not yet available....Requires a back case that defeats the beauty of the back panel finish....EMUI sucks once again however the functional options that it offers is far superior to the vanilla version....Takes quite some time to figure out all the options in the settings....Go for Nova launcher for a clean UI....Speed of charging is the fastest across all charging technologies.When compared to the price of Apple phones this one is a steal considering all the specs.Camera is awesome especially the night mode. Up there with the best. Totally satisfied. Amazon was spot on with packing, security and delivery.",1
1,Fingerprint not Woking for Apps like banking or any other Apps which fingerprint Enabled,0
5,"I have ordered this on January 1st, expected a Wireless charger as Gift but was little disappointed.This is based on my couple of days of use. The mobile itself feels premium in hands with its colour (Twilight Blue rocks too bad you will end up covering it's gorgeous back with a case). You definitely need a strong case to protect this mobile as I see this could cost a fortune for your carelessness.In the hands it looks bit tight, slightly lighter than Note 8 or 9, it's Notch definitely takes some amount of top display.Overall build quality if not like iPhones, it is definitely premium like Galaxy range mobile.Display is one of the best. Curved edges reminiscent of Galaxy mobiles. AMOLED really peaks your eyes with popping colours. Display options allow you to play with tones. These are becoming increasingly standard now a days.Performance is excellent so far though I am no Gamer or heavy video user. No sign of lagging when doing many things.Camera is simply the best out in the market. There is absolutely no competition so far. Low light, portrait, landscape all coming out with great amount of detail and accuracy in colour. Haven't tested video recording. You may need bigger storage option because each portrait itself occupies 8 MB.Wireless charging is good, battery performance requires more testing but based on my Honor 10 experience, and Kirin 980 7nm SoC clearly going to deliver optimal and efficient performance...I have no doubts.Call quality, speaker performance (Dolby Atmos), network coverage options like WiFi, VoLTE all seamlessly working bout of the box.EMUI 9.0 based on Android Pie gives you great experience, customisation options in notification, but launcher itself is outdated look (mimics iOS).All iPhone features like navigation dock, FaceID(it is good for me) working fine. onscreen fingerprint sensor doesn't disappoint. I use navigation dock gestures for home screen, going back, close all etc...cards like preview of apps in use kind of resembles iOS.This is certainly no one handed phone for the most. It would be nice if they put a screen protector like they do it for Honor 10.I have to get it's music capabilities yes I could find audio jack something that is becoming big discussion point.It is IP68 rated for water resistant, it's AI capabilities in various things related to Face Recognition, Camera Portrait, Google lense a real advantage for auto focus etcOverall, this is expensive but it's never a compromise. It has all capabilities of iPhone XS Max but almost 50% less! You won't complain for sure!All the best and wishing you all a very happy new year!",1
1,The product doesn't have CDMA capability as the seller advertises.,0
5,"You really can't go wrong with the battery life on this phone. Main priority and it nails it.The camera is second to Google's photography but it definitely has it's optical advantages of the superior lenses.The audio quality is OK i guess, don't really bust rhymes out of the speaker much so wasn't affected by the speaker placement behind the type C port.Emui sucks. Get a 3rd party launcher as soon as you get it. But I must warn you that gesture navigation works really bad with 3rd party launchers.Also, i am not a big fan of the color, i really expected a standard black color option but huawei for some reason thought it's a good idea to enter the Indian market with a green and twilight color options with no standard ones.The standby time is hopeless unless you turn off all internet connections and put the phone on battery before going to bed.You really can't find a much faster charging solution as of right now. I have seen it go from a dead cell to 90% in 35min. The last 10% is slow. Like OP6 dash charge speeds. Yes, i considered that as slow as you have no idea how quick this is to charge are 4200 battery to 90% in 35 min. It's stupid fast.There are other gimmicks like reverse wireless charging which I've used it a few times, it's helpful when yyor friend has wireless charging and his battery is dead as  battery never dies.Here's the thing, my previous phone, samsung S8+, i charged it twice a day. I'm such a user.And the same person could not kill the battery in one day of this beast.Huawei really did many things right and I'm satisfied with that I've received.",0
5,"I don't like the finger print scan it sucks really.. remaining it's the best ever phone that seen and touched.. ppl who purchased Samsung and I phones.. why not buy a phone which has everything, 3Dscanning, edge screen, oppo kind of front fingerprint, with lots of innovation.. just go for it..",1
5,"Simply awesome in all aspects, It would have great if Huawei give wireless charging device with extra cost also ok, I was using honor view 10 earlier so I did not feel much difference except display ... Missed bundled offer ( wireless headphone) because of not understanding Amazon offer rules,",0
5,"One of the best phones.Pros: Super cameras, extraordinary battery performance, visual appeal.Priavte space is one of the best feature which I liked and is very useful.EMUI software has both pros n cons but it still need to improve a lot in it's overall usage ease.Cons: In display fingerprint reader.",1
5,"I was using google pixel 3 XL for about a month, before that pixel 2 for a year , after i bought mate 20 pro which i got on 8/12/18 ,It seems that google and apple phones are just piece of crap , i don't have words to describe the awesomeness of this phone, close your eyes and buy this it will not disappoint in any manner",0
5,I still didn't get time for capture pic through the primary camera. Which was that much hype. But I capture selfie which is quiet good and as per expection. Headphone is good but I am not comfortable with the size so I am using the extension type c with audio jack. Quality is same.,0

5,"Never felt better after using a smartphone more than this one. The last time there was this much hype for a phone, it was Samsung's Galaxy S3 in 2012.

5,"Wow... This phone is awesome. Brand snobs, go take a hike!Here is the summary why I love this phone:1. Design: its very very beautiful with gradient colours and curved edges from both front and back. The signature camera module looks dope and arouses curiosity! 10/102. Display: Amoled display is very bright and Vibrant. Wish it would be more vibrant. Still an absolutely satisfying display with unparalled sharpness! 9/103. Battery: When it comes to battery this phone is King of Kings the metaphorical ""Betaj Badshah""! Works full day however heavy user you are and the best thing is charges insanely fast! Like 75 percent in 30min that's crazy!! 11/104. Performance: The performance is flagship grade as is expected from a phone at this price point. KIRIN 980 is the fastest android soc to date so you can kill it in pubg or fortnite without a hiccup! 10/105. Camera: It takes stunning portraits, Epic night shots, dazzling landscapes with its array of cameras! The only phone even close to the quality is pixel 3 but that too only in terms of portraits and night sight. Even pixel 3 cannot touch this phone in zoom performance, auto lowlights, details, resolution, wide angle, macros, flash performance, colour accuracy and edge detection! It's impossibly good. 10/106.Software: This is one place where Huawei can work better. No issues as such, the software is dizzyingly fast and responsive with impressive features like knock gestures, it just feels too much. Should be a bit lean with less oem apps. 9/107. Other features: Too many great features are an USP of this mobile. The 3d face scanning is a boon and all android makers must start using it. It's extremely fast and extremely accurate and secure all at the same time, works in multiple angles with multiple lighting conditions, even direct sunlight is no match! The in display fingerprint scanner is a tad slower but feels very futuristic and is accurate. The IR blaster, rarely found in flagships, is a life saver! 10/10Conclusion: There are no phones without cons and this phone is no exception. But the sheer number of useful innovations and tech packed into such a beautiful body is truly amazing and inspiring to the whole Industry. All in all its the most rounded and complete feeling phone to date! (and I used to think pixels are where rainbow is!)",1
5,"*Background*Previous devices: 1. Moto Z Play - had been using for 2 years, but the phone app was giving some problems. Had wanted to try iOS to understand differences with Android, so ended up buying 2. iPhone SE some 3 month back, which I was quite satisfied with except it being single SIM, and small screen (which has its advantages also especially for handling and navigating) and poor resolution (not a good experience for viewing pictures or editing them using the Lightroom app). Hence, was in no hurry to buy a phone, but was sort of missing a good quality 'proper' phone.I was following all the new releases, and my main prerequisites were: 1. Good quality camera, 2. Good battery life, 3. OLED screen, 4. Responsive phone and UI. Some of the considerations in no particular order were: 1. iPhone XS / XS Max: quite expensive, found the stock keyboard without glide / swipe feature very limiting. 2. Google Pixel 3 XL: uncertain about battery life, and some of the YouTube reviewers had demonstrated that 4 GB RAM proved somewhat insufficient. Also, Mate 20 Pro's camera's image quality seemed at par or better / marginally worse than Pixel's in most reviews I came across. 3. Note 9 / Galaxy S9+: Samsung UI is a big no-no; phone seems to get very slow after few months (wife has S8+), 4. OnePlus 6T: Absence of 2K resolution screen, camera wasn't very confidence inspiring.Coming to Huawei Mate 20 Pro: Initial apprehension was about EMUI, which I hadn't liked much, and was having preference for stock Android, but compared to all other contenders mentioned above it seemed to be the best compromise. My expectations were: good camera, good battery endurance (because of large battery and 7 nm process chip.My experience so far...*Pros*1. Look and feel: The finish, feel in the hand, the gloss and gradient of Twilight color back are all great! The accompanying case gives a bit of rhomboid pattern to the back, and it's the first time I've put a case on my phone in many years. Phone feels optimally heavy and balanced, isn't very slippery (with case on), and not too bad to use with single hand because of its relatively narrow width.2. Screen: Very sharp, and vivid. I found it a bit cool for my taste, but it's easy to change its temperature, which I did.3. Responsiveness and user interface: It's been just 2 days, but every app is very responsive. I've not installed any game, but am perfectly satisfied with this aspect. I've enabled full gesture UI, and am very, very happy happy with it. Especially, the 'back' feature used by swiping from either sides of the screens is very useful and intuitive. I wouldn't want to go back to using a back button again!4. Unlock methods: (a) Fingerprint scanner is reliable, but a bit less quick and consistent compared to capacitive sensor I had on Moto Z Play, but I hardly need to use it, because the (b) Face ID system works perfectly, very quickly and unobtrusively. I've enabled looking at the phone as a requisite to unlock, which supposedly makes it more secure. And, its responsiveness seems to improve with more number of uses.5. Battery life: Difficult to comment as it's just 2 days, but it's very impressive. Yesterday with over 3.5 h screen on time and total time since charge of 16 hours, I was left with ~65% battery. I haven't used the provided stock fast charger yet, so can't comment on the charging speed.6. Camera: Have hardly clicked any pictures, and a few I'd tried in a mundane setting under blue light of fluorescent 'tube light' were grainy, and not as sharp as I'd have liked. But when I compared with Samsung Galaxy S8+ my feeling was that Samsung's processing (especially over sharpening and noise removal with resultant loss of details upon zooming) made the pictures look better than Mate 20 Pro's, but the gradient of skin tone was captured more faithfully by the latter. There's also a 'vivid' color mode while capturing, but it makes the pictures look very artificial, but some might still indeed like it.7. Sound from external speakers. There's no exact standard to compare against, but I'm satisfied with the ringtone loudness and quality. I'd tried listening to few old Bollywood songs, and they sounded nice, but I felt iPhone SE's output had felt fuller. Quality through earphones (1MORE Triple Driver Earphone: http://amzn.in/d/57nQ1sR ) seemed good, but haven't heard much yet.*Cons*1. User interface: I find the icons a bit childish. I can use other launchers like Nova, but will lose some features. Only one major complaint I have is that to bring down the notification shade one has to swipe up all the way from the top towards the bottom. If I end up swiping from somewhat below the topmost level, 'HiVision' (a kind of quick search  for apps, web pages, etc.) gets initiated, which is annoying. I also wish double tapping on the home screen could've been assigned some feature (e.g., turning off the screen). I've enabled complete gesture navigation. Initially I was having trouble invoking the task view, but I figured out that best way to do it is to swipe up till around bottom fourth of the screen, and then drag the thumb down a bit instead of just holding it still there.[Update dated March 16, 2019: I've started using Nova launcher. Using it I can access the notification shade just by swiping down anywhere from the home screen, so I'm happy about that. Only minor grudge with the UI I now have is that the app switcher view functions in a bit unintuitive way, i.e., the most recent app automatically shifts to the right of the screen instead of remaining at the centre. Another inbuilt limitation of EUMI is that horizontal scrolling between apps in the app switcher view is very slow compared to the competing UIs like that of OnePlus, Samsung, Pixel, etc.]2. Automatic screen brightness: For some situations, the screen brightness goes too low, and I've to manually turn it up.3. New contacts are by default saved in Huawei's account instead of Google account, so I've to manually change that to latter from a drop down menu each time. Annoying! Will see if this setting can be changed.All in all, I'm very happy to have this phone, and some times I use it only because it feels so good to use it! :D Of course, the novelty will wear off in some time.I'll try to update this review with any new opinions I form, and possibly a few pictures.If you've reached till here, thanks for your attention! :)*Update with night shots*I'll say the camera is better than any other phone camera I've seen up till now. The pictures I've uploaded are from a very dark scene, and yet the details are good with very little noise. One of the pictures is from telephoto lens (3x zoom), which is the only optically stabilized lens, but with narrower aperture, and yet the font on the display board in top left of the picture is seen with very crisp boundaries. I've to agree with many YouTube reviewers that the night mode should be used only in extreme darkness if you're alright with loss of details. The dynamic range of this camera especially in dark is far better than that of Galaxy S8+ (if that helps).",1

Amazing battery and super-fast charging, Good camera and personally explored Mate camera in many occasions, lot Improved technologies like reverse charging etc, No heating issue in 3 months span compare to Samsung.

5,The phone overall is absolutely beast.Battery life is too good best in flagship mobiles.Face recognition works absolutely great even in very dark.Low light camera mode:- I don't know what they have done to this but this gives great quality of photo even in very low light.The display though is same as galaxy s9 plus actually greater quality then that except the notch.The notch can be disabled even the space can be used by the battery % or other things.The camera is great especially the wide angle is absolutely fantastic.The camera helps you to take the picture in 98% of situations in daily usage.The battery gives u 7-8 hours of on screen.If u play pubg or fortnite and use harsh or hard usage through out the day u still remain with 40% of battery before going to bedThe mobile charges very fast u cannot believe it.It neads 10 min charge then done a day full of battery.The front camera is not that good but okay in overall.The mobile looks fantastic premium in hand.,1
5,All aspects it's wonderful.but don't buy any huawei phones or it's sub Brand Honor's phone.on 20 th of May Google has gives announcement that from today onwards they will never support those company about any support of software Android version and updates.so wait for huawei reaction what will they say.,0
5,"Glad I bought it the first day of launch. This is the best smartphones as of now in the market. Beats all flagships ( apple, pixel, Samsung, one plus) hands down with its performance, camera and the sheer looks.Lucky to have got the free awesome PCX550 wireless headphone as well.Best buy !",1
5,Huawei mate 20 pro is arguably the best smart phone in the market.I have been using note 8 for the past 14 months and the battery life of note was bad. I am a heavy phone user and mate 20 pro gives me good 1 day. With heavy usage.The only downside I found with the phone was the front camera which tends to bleach any photo you take.,1
5,Lets make it short.Camera is not that good S9plus camera quality is far better Dxo camera rating is corrupt.Always on display has no options to choose from.Battery is awesome it gives 6hours screen on time where S9plus is 3.5 hours. And still its slim and gives good feel. And every thing is good or you can say similar to samsung flagship,1
5,The good points have been listed by everyone already. Only con is the finger print sensor - Needs a lot of improvement. Face unlock is quick and works better on this phone. Another issue is the soft cover provided with the phone. It's not structured to protect the rear camera. One will have to go for a better cover built by third parties,0
5,"Crisp performer, very good camera, battery is awesome.. Charger is best 40watt.Selfie camera needs to improve not as good compare to note9.Overall great product",1
5,Awesome phone.... Far better than samsung note series... Using note 8 but in all departments mate 20 pro beats note series... In note series battery drains fast but mate 20 pro got longevity in battery... Further mate 20 got ir blaster which is lacking in note series.,1
4,Super camera like a DSLR 📸Super battery lifeBut ram or. Strong I do not like good.1 plus 6t Better than this.And Fingerprint scanner does not work in glass Guard only works in buff guard.Wireless charger with it was free But not given me.Working customers to make owls out of Amazon.,1
5,"I received it on 4th Dec after booking on 3rd Dec.I strike jackpot at 71,990/- price with Senneheiser PXC 550 Headphones.Mate 20 Pro is far superior than One plus 6T or IPhone X as compared.Camera is the main feature of this mobile.You can take miniatures in Super Macro mode.It consists 3 back Camera's & 1 front camera.Battery is Superb with 2 days + Talk time.Slim to fit perfect in your hands.Overall it's a Great Phone with Great features,Great Cameras,Great Display.You have to go for it to feel it's power.",1
5,I like camera,0
5,"24 hours of using this phone. Last phone Samsung Note 9 - I have been a Samsung fan past few years, my first Huawei Experience and it's been fantastic. I bought the Note 9 just coz of the S Pen but only used it few times while clicking photos. It was not easy to hold in hand coz of its big size and the battery life sucks considering I am power user where I stream Netflix every day while commuting to the office. Huawei has impressed me with the battery life trust me its the best on any phone I have ever seen. The fast charger is superb like 70% charge in 30minutes or so. The camera is absolutely magic, way better than Note 9. Will use it for a few days and then see how Huawei makes me a complete fan of its brand or will switch to Note 10 in the future. For now its 5 out of 5.",1
5,"Huawei mate 20 pro is an exceptionally brilliant phone. Camera quality, battery backup, speed etc all is top notch. I could easily put this up in top, compared to any current android phone out there in market. My only con is that it is not using a regular micro sd card though 128gb of internal space should be sufficient but excess 4k recordings will fill that in no time.",1
4,"The phone is actually really very good, but the price Huawei charges for this phone is high. I was & am still using The Galaxy Note 9 and I'm gonna stick with it. I'll probably sell the Mate 20 pro. Detailed review below.1) I just love the Mates battery backup, it's the best flagship phone with excellent battery backup. Better then the note 9. The phone charges very fast too. 10/10 for battery. And the reverse wireless charging us just a gimmick. It charges other phones very slowly.2) The mate 20 pro screams PREMIUM. The curved AMOLED 2K display, textured glass back, the slim profile, coloured power button & everything else is eye catching. 9/10 for design.3) I'm not into mobile gaming so no comments on gaming, but the performance of the phone is so fluid. The phone feels snappy & fast. I have the EMUI. I always prefer stock Android or the OnePlus oxygen UI. Still their are loads of customization options but the UI still needs tweaking. 9/10 for performance, 7/10 for UI.4) the finally the camera or in other words CAMERAS, one of The best cameras I've ever used on a phone (please don't compare with pixel 3) the ultra wide angle camera changes the whole perspective of mobile photography. You have to use it to believe it. 9/10 for camera.Verdict: I consider this phone worth 60k to 63k, but if you have the money to spend, just go for it. One of the best smartphones of 2018..........",1
5,"Amazing product from Huawei, some of the pros are:The edge display, quad HD display, face recognition quality, the camera and battery.OverallBuild quality is very good and the highlight for me is the twilight blue color. It's an absolute head turner.Cons are yet to be found on the operational stand view, maybe the pricing could have been better. I felt the pricing to be slightly on the higher side. But that's a personal openion.",0
5,"A very ergonomic, robust and best quality phone available in the market. Has features which even the Samsung, iPhone do not have. Great speed, smooth to work between apps, great phone for multi tasking. Battery life is great. A full charging comes for. Me for solid 2 days.",1
4,"Bought mate 20 pro on December 5th 2018. Pros:Best phone with so many features that you can explore, awesome camera, better battery life and good screen.Con:The only con I saw was, the in screen finger print recognition is not good its hard many times for quick access.",1
4,phone is best. camera quality is best to best every right now to compare all smart phones. but music time phone performance to bad not bass in heardfone.and Bluetooth earpiece sound sound quality to poor. after few days facing battery draining issue.,1
5,"Great all rounder.For the price you won't find any better smartphone than the mate 20 pro.Hands down best battery, great display, super quick charging speeds, good cameras, over all power packed.",1

3,"1.Display-great!2.Build quality - good, though lower than apple or samsung flagships.3.Performance- very good. Will wait to see over a few months.4. Power consumption and management- may be the  best of them all. Top rating.5. Cameras - all hype.. nowhere near apple nor samsung. Buy a A9 you will be better off if you are buying this for the versatile camera. Pro mode is useless. Which means the sensor is not good. It is all a work of the AI and post processing. No wonder DXOMark did not rate it..6. Lastly the finger print sensor fails 3/5 times. Painful and useless.",1
5,First of all thanks to Amazon for delivering the product within a Day and also sending Wireless Charger with the package.Now starting with the Features.1. Camera - The camera is exceptionally excellent which delivers more than what  it says.The Wide angle camera gives a new perspective.FOR night photography better to shoot without Night mode as it gives much better picture.Super Macro mode let's you go as close as 2.5 cm from an object.Other modes are also good.Front camera is good but it could have been better.Have attached some of the shots clicked without Night mode.2. Battery - Battery is also good. It can last for a day if u r a heavy user and for more than one day if u r not a heavy user. Also the charger is Super fast as it can charge upto 70% in less than 30 min. You can buy Wireless charger also in Bundle offer.3. Kirin980 processor--Huawei's kirin 980 processor is beast with exceptional speed and features.4. Memory - It comes with 6gb ram and 128 gb storage that can be expanded but the disadvantage is to find the nano memory card as it's only provided by Huawei in limited markets.5. Design - This is one more department in which Huawei makes other companies Phone look cheap.Huawei phones have amazing design with Gorilla Glass on front and back.6.EMUI- Only thing I don't like in Huawei and Honor phones is the UI. Please change the UI.The Android Pie Update is amazing which gives you many new features. Loved the gestures feature as it gives easy usage and handling.It is also having IP68 RATING for dust and water protection.Face Unlock works great in Dark light too.So it's a good buy for the price. You will be extremely satisfied with the product,0
5,Con: The inscreen fingerprint sensor is not as fast and accurate as Samsung S10+ Huawei P30 ProPro: Almost everything else...do not get fooled by  2019's Snapdragon855 powered phones mate 20 pro still outperforms them with outstanding optimisation in software and if you have even basic photography knowledge it destroys any other current flagship except P30 Pro. For the ui i recommend Nova or Lean launcher if you are fond of stock android thats about it,1

5,"I have been using it for last 3 months and i can say that it is best in every sector whether it be camera, battery, screen, performance, UI . Twilight blue has become signature for Mate 20 pro.. pulling the attention of everyone around you.My verdict i think if you compare it with the latest samsung  galaxy10, it still packs a solid punch . The design will surely attract you, 7nm chipset is crazily fast.",1
5,"This phone is the best in market right now. Using it for past few months no problems whatsoever. No glue gate nothing.Service is excellent.I was not finding smart cover for the fone anywhere in my city, I came across guys working with Huawei who were on a visit in a Croma store and told them this problem. One of them took my no and to my surprise I got a call today saying they have got the genuine phone case all the way from China.What could be better service than this?Amazed.",1

5,After quite a bit of research I ended up buying this phone a couple of weeks back. Oh my and I was pleasantly surprised with what the phone offered.Amazing speed and responsiveness . The touch feels very good .The on screen fingerprint scanner is very comfortable if not as responsive and precise as the physical fingerprint scanner. It does require putting a bit of pressure than a simple touch. Face detection is very good.And the best part is the camera. The pictures are mind blowing . This is a phone I can surely recommend for one of the best cameras around. After taking pics on iPhone and Samsung note series I feel Huawei has beaten them all. The selfie camera also clicks great portraits but sometimes softens it a bit.I have seen many complaining about EMUI interface. I haven’t find it as a glitch to complain about.Yes the price I find a bit much. I bought it outside India at a great offer .Huawei mate 20 pro is great piece to lay your hands in.,1
5,"Used so many expensive phones in my now I finally got real phone in my hand, photos are better than xs my brother is using, battery is better than any of the phone around, wireless reverse charging is super cool feature... I'm just goin mad exploring new features everyday",1
4,"Whichever phone you buy make sure battery and camera is good.This one rocks both.will upload pictures soon.right now uploaded a video on youtube comparing the FP scanner to oneplus 6tsearch ""drtechnno"" on youtube.also check gluegate issue.have compared boe and lg displays and how to check them",1

5,"Mate 20 Pro is an ultimate multiuse mobile phone.Amazing camera, good stabilization and low light photos,Beautiful quad HD OLED screen,Superb battery life,Audio quality is also better than most flagship phones, but little low.Very handy,Beautiful color.My only gripe is that it is available only in Twilight colour and not in Emerald Green which has a vinyl like texture on the back which might have given more grip to the phone and also less fingerprints on the back.I've been using it's iphone like Face ID more than it's optical fingerprint sensor inside the screen, as it is more accurate, quick and easy to use and unlock the device.Even though it had curved edges, no functionality and usability like Samsung Galaxy Edge quick app launchers, etc.Kirin 980 maybe better than Snapdragon 845. I've two SD 845 mobiles, one is LG G7 4GB version and the other is Vivo Nex 8 GB version. Mate 20 Pro is better than both, at least more snappy than G7 and some times better than Nex. It's a performance beast with 6 GB RAM, wish they've given 8 GB RAM though.Overall, a very well balanced feature rich mobile.It took me a while to get convinced to buy this, instead of Galaxy S10. Indian version of Galaxy S10 models have Exynos chips, which aren't that great compared to its Qualcomm Snapdragon counterparts.So, whoever are planning to buy any Galaxy S10 models consider this instead.Thank you Amazon for the next morning delivery.",1
5,I have been using the phone for the past 3 months. I was one of the initial buyers who received Senheisser headset as part of the launch. The best things are:1. Battery life--I easily get 36 to 48 hours of battery life. Specifically mentioning hours to signify that it is not days like morning to evening but good 2 full days2.Camera: Out of the world. Best camera pics I have seen on any mobile including equally priced (in US) iPhone XS3. Look and feel of the phone is just outstanding4. Some may say software is not to their liking but I found some useful apps/capabilities that I missed in earlier phone. Updates are frequent as well.5. Spend 70k on this one rather than iPhone X or even higher value on XS. I understand OS are totally different but novelty of this phone outclassed iPhone,1

No decision is yours.",1
5,In screen finger print sensor is a little slacky... But overall an awesome phone... Great 4 night shots and overall performance is just top notch...

5,"I've been debating over buying a phone for quite a while. I saw that this phone was not due to be released till the 15th. I couldn't wait, I had ordered it from aliexpress. There were delays in shipping them out so I ordered one from Amazon. I personally don't like Samsung phones. I've been using pixels since they were launched and I was amazed by the low light shots it could take. The huawei phones pretty much flew under the radar and didn't seem much of an upgrade.This phone changed everything.The camera is good, low light shots are incredibly detailed. I can see the freakin moon with the craters (almost) without my telescope (celestron astromaster 130eq Md). The ai scene identification is accurate. Videos are average though.  The camera has tons of modes and a very customizable manual mode.The UI needs a little getting used to from a stock android user perspective.  The voice call quality for both the acoustic display and the microphone are very good.Gaming is a blast, I could game for 3hours of Pubg before the phone needing a recharge. The 4200mah battery and the supercharger make life so much better.The display is fhd plus. You should have no issues playing 4k videos downloaded from anywhere.You can connect the phone to the TV using a USB 3.1 to hdmi adapter and use it as a chromebook. Wireless also works but there is a little bit of latency, which is to be expected. You can also game this way.Overall I'm very very satisfied with the purchase. Its and blind buy. Multi tasking is a breeze.To get most of the battery, use a dark theme and a black wallpaper as this is an AMOLED display.",1
5,"I received 2 updates after the American Govt. has banned Huawei. Camera Daylight shots have improved. Skin tones specifically. Added the Dual Video Mod as well.Google has promised a Android Q update as wellm So fingers crossed. Continue reading fr d rest.The p30 pro is indeed an optic heaven, and those looking to buy one know that already.Plenty of videos on youtube to support my statement and my camera clicks. A phone that clicks the moon from my balcony, now thts simply WOW!--Now what is interesting is exploring the rest of the phone which is not as refined as the optics and coming from ONEPLUS's oxygen OS i have a thing or two to mention.--Firstly the miui IS THE BIGGEST LETDOWN, Hands down lets get tht out of the way, if you can live with that n want the best battery and camera experience a phone can offer, please buy this beauty. It has the looks for it as well.The battery honestly is good and the charging speed even better. Music lovers(via headsets) will not be dissapointer as the In box earphones do a commendable job in delivering audio.The screen is GOOD, i have not extensively used quad HD screens but coming from oneplus 5T it was a pleasent surprise. The curve screen is curved enough that it looks sexy without causing accidental touches.There are hidden customization options in a complicated settings menu, i wud recommend watching a Youtube video to get the most out of your device incase u r interested.Rest this phone speaks volumes how Optics in a camera phone have advanced.I wanted The best camera experience that a phone could offer and for me THIS IS IT! Samsungs wide camera is better but overall this rates higher in my books, FYI low light mode is tip of the iceberg. The camera mods this phone has like live photos, macro shots water style photos to name a FEW will keep u excites for quite a while.Again i wud highly recommend watching an indepth camera guide as you are spending 70000 on this device.Recommended those who want the best camera exp, Not recommended to those who want the best UI.OS: 6Camera: 11/10(nt even exaggerating)Battery: 9Calling: 9Ease of use: 8charging: 10(wired n wireless) Fastest in d market as of now.",1

5,"I was waiting for this product since the launch in Paris. Bought the phone as soon as it launched in India.I got Huawei GT Sport Watch in the bundle offer. About the phone:Camera: Camera quality is superb and far ahead of what can be expected from a smartphone. Superb portrait mode, 50X digital zoom though you need to be a pro to use it efficiently. But it has the capability of producing the best quality images whether in normal mode, zoom mode, portrait mode, AI mode, AR Scan, Aperture mode, etc. There is n number of features which are yet to be explored. No other phone is near to its camera quality and features.Design: super premium look sleek, slim and a beauty. Breathing Crystal is fascinating and it sets itself apart from other devices.Battery: Amazing to see the back up of this device. After moderate to heavy use in the entire day, it remained close to 30% which is fantastic considering its hardware and screen size.The fingerprint sensor is quick, face unlock works pretty well, the screen produces fantastic colors with a smooth touch.There are many other features which are yet to be explored. Superb device! Best camera phone in the market, 50X ZoOoOOooOOOoooM is mind-boggling. Huawei GT Watch (Y)Thank you, Amazon for single day delivery.",1
5,"I keep changing my phones very often. I never got satisfied with a single phone including the S10 plus or iphone xs max or pixel 3 xl. Every phone was good at something but lacked elsewhere. This is the phone which after many many years made me settle in one phone. I will stay with it till mate 30 shows up 😁Of course as everyone says it has got the best camera so far in a smart phone. You have to try it to believe it. I like the zoom and night mode which is better than any phone I have tried but I was stubbed by the clarity at which it takes pictures. Really amazing. These days I take a ton of super macro pictures and I loved the light painting  option. Haven't seen that before. The video mode has its own surprises. It has effects which are not seen in other phones. Effects like AI color which magically makes the background black and white leaving only the human subject in color without a mistake every time and back ground blur which blurs the back ground of the subject in a video and holds the blur even as you move around in a video is phenomenal.But camera is just one part of the story. The battery charges to a 100% in one hour and holds the charge for one and a half days. For battery junkies this phone is a must have. Many days my phone is still at 50% at the end of the day.Claorie counter is a cool way to impress your friends. Wireless projection gives desktop experience wirelessly on your tv by just using this phone.  Then there is a wireless gameplay option which puts you directly inside a game. The phone uses the time of flight camera in it's back to ide tify the subject and mimics their actions in the game, which is really cool.The screen is Full HD+ but I never felt the need for a higher resolution. I understand huawei wanted this to be a battery champion and thought Full HD+ is good enough which I completely agree.Then there is emy, the huawei assistant which does only two things as far as I know. One is call somebody which is really accurate and really too fast and second one is if you mis places your phone and you are searching for your phone in the room, you can just say 'OK Emy, where are you' and she will make a sweet sound to let you know where she is.People usually say EMUI is not upto the mark. I also thought so in the beginning but I got used to it. Anyway I use Evie launcher Instead of the default launcher.Performance wise the phone is blazing fast with it's 7nm chipset of Kiron 980 and 8gb Ram. Never I felt a lag or experienced a crash. It's smooth as butter.The only thing which thought huawei could have done better is one - speakers. They could have given stereo speakers. I understand there is no earphone speaker because the phone uses cutting edge technology to vibrate the glass and produce Sound like the vivo nex, but I still feel stereo speakers would be better tha a single down firing speaker at the bottom. Second thing is I wish they have an option to switch between data connection right from the notification bar shortcuts. I keep moving between data connections in my dual sim setup. Every time I had to goto the settings to change the sim for data connection.Overall a phenomenal Product. I dont care about the drama played by America on huawei and the whole trade war thing. I bought my second p30 pro for my father after the ban imposed on huawei by USA and google told they won't support huawei in future. I really don't care. The phone is an absolute beast and best today and will take me into 2020 and beyond for my father without any problems. There are so many features hidden for you to discover and enjoy. So it feels like new everyday. Great Job Huawei. Looking forward for mate 30 pro in October.",1

If anyone is thinking buying apple and other mobile same this price segment so just once try this.Thank you.",1
5,Feel of the Fone ♥ Speed at its Ferrari like....... Camera.. Exceptionally Awsome....... Loved the color.. And combo offer of watch.. Worth it...Better than samsung series.. Used for 10 years..,1
5,"I bought the phone in replacement of Apple iPhone 7 and as of now I don't repent it. I am a big fan of iOS but Apple has recently dissappointed big time when it comes to innovation and hardware specs.Coming to Huawei P30 Pro - The phone is a beast when it comes to performance. Specs are all stated here so I would like to brief more about the user experience - The big screen is a bit intimidating. People having experience of 5"" and below screen size might find time to adjust. The OS is glitch free and gives a smooth running experience. UI could have tweaked a lil bit more but nevertheless there are other phone models in the market to serve the purpose. Camera specs and software support is outstanding. The response time in application processing is the best I have seen so far. The GPU is one of the best I have come across and considering the fact that I am an avid gamer - there were no heating issues, which I believe Huawei has made a major point here. Battery life - Splendid!Key points which I believe will improve - Playstore optimization for many apps.The fingerprint sensor has glitches which I have personally experienced.Overall the phone is a good buy for long term purpose and who does not wish to invest in a DSLR!!",1

3,"This phone is the most overrated flagship of 2019. Except for a few things (which is only main camera and battery life) nothing in this phone is at the flagship level.Screen is no match to Samsung or Apple, though it is not bad but it is certainly not flagship level. EMUI is the crappiest Android skin ever used, both in terms of aesthetics and usability. So many bugs. Above all Video quality in a camera centric phone is nothing to write home about. It's worse than last year phones; at 30 fps panning, video quality is so bad that you won't even like shooting from it. It is indeed that bad of stuttering. 5x zoom isn't very practical and this periscope 5x zoom can not do 2x or 3x zoom. for that the camera just does digital zoom. Some of the other issues that I experienced even after first update 9.1.0.1361. Video recording is pathetic in a device which is claiming to be high end. It is worst than a mid range phones. So much stuttering while panning in both FHD and 4k in 30 fps mode. Practically unusable videos. Not as sharp and clean as my friend’s S10 plus. Slow motion videos are totally muddy and lack any kind of detail. Video with 5x zoom is the worst of all, and isn’t useful at all. By the kind of video quality this phone is producing, it can not be even called a flagship phone.2. Ultra wide angle camera’s color reproduction is so much different than the main camera. An extremely high degree of contrast in Ultra Wide mode.3. Third party Launcher don’t work properly in so many scenarios. I’hv already shared my feedback in previous emails that any third party launcher affects the behavior of recent apps UI. App cards loading animation looks quite patchy and unrefined. And also the entire screen gets bluish color cast each time I unlock the phone and use recent apps UI for the first time.Not allowing third party launchers to work properly on phones ruins the very nature of Android's customizability and is quite user-hostile approach from Huawei.4. Default launcher has no customization features at all. Can’t use icon packs from playstore. (Huawei themes are so pathetic and meant for only punks). No gesture customization. No Icon scaling. Can’t remove that launcher orb which is 2 generations older Android design. Practically no customization. No gestures at all.5. Grouped Notification doesn’t go the app directly. I’m forced to always click on an individual message from a single app in the notification drawer.6. 2x and 3x zoom which are more practical for daily usage are way worse than 5x zoom.7. Can’t pull navigation from the lock screen. Have to unlock the phone for even basic toggles.8. Overall EMUI is one of the worst looking UI for me. Android’s basic UI is so much better both in aesthetics and usability.9. So many unnecessary apps duplicating the same core utilities in OS (mail, files, calendar, clock, calculator and dialer) EMUI’s default apps are practically trash in comparison to the same apps made and well maintained by Google",1
5,"This is a Beast of a smart phone..Design- The breathing Crystal does take your breath away.. The phone feels like a premium smartphone on your hands.. Everybody who looks at your phone would ask you about the phone.. The phone has an I.r blaster that does come in handy sometimes that the other phones lacks these days.. The only thing missing is the 3.5 mm jackDisplay- Even though I was a bit disappointed with WQHD display not being a part of the specs but trust me, you won't find be able to find the difference.. The colours are punchy.. The display being a FHD + display packs a solid punchBattery life- One word.. STELLAR. Just put your phone on charging and go for a shower.. The phone is ready waiting for you  till the time you get ready that would last you through out the day without any doubts.. I have not charged my phone more than once in a day since the time I have purchased it..Perfomance- Fast, smooth and hassle free.. The processor of this phone is crazy fast.. Multi tasking is buttery smooth..People complaining about the O.S not being a user friendly can download Nova launcher.. It's one of the best smartphone launchers available with plenty of customisations providing you stock android experience without compromising any of the features this phone packs.. I have attached an image of my homescreen to give you an example what it looks like..Sound Quality--the phone is loud enough to enjoy music on the go.. Though it's not that crisp. Mostly all of us listen to music or watch movies on earphones or use Bluetooth speakers these days so that's not much of an issue..Camera- Haha.. I dont even want to talk about the Camera of this phone because everybody knows by now that if there's any phone that totally dominates smart phone photography at the moment.. It's Huawei p30 pro.. The zoom, the night mode being two of the most exclusive features that no phone can match at the moment..Everything about this phone is just amazing.. There are innovations that the mobile industry needs.. That is what huawei provides us with.. Every breakthrough in the smartphone sector comes from Huawei first and then the other smartphones the just copy what they do..If you are looking for a premium smartphone and your budget allows you to choose between smartphones in this price range.. Go for P30 pro.. Trust me.. This is a beauty",1
5,"One of the best phones in the world right now and the lecia camera is right now the costliest camera ever used on the phone and this is the reason Huawei has cut costs on the screen by providing a full hd display and used it on the camera, Headphone audio quality is also impressive and better than the competitors barring LG the only minus point is the display its not even close to the competitor level",1
5,"True flagship phone from Huawei. Camera is perfect, battery life is beyond par. Just the display is a bit behind when compared to S10plus and Oneplus 7pro but that's fine. I love  my phone. If 70k can be your budget then buy P30 pro without any doubt.",1

4,"Detailed reviews. Something which will help many of them to choose or not to choose this product. (Before writing review I will mention that I have used iPhone XS, XR, OnePlus 6t and other flagship phones too)1. Camera, everyone is talking about the camera and trust me it doesn't disappoint anywhere. It has the best camera, with AI it give much more than expected. Low light, 50x zoom, portrait mode are no doubt amazing. This is seriously best camera phone one can buy.2. Battery, the ultimate part about this phone is, it's battery, 4200 mah gives you a day and more.3. Screen, A bit disappoint but could be ignored. The curve display is really good, but colours are not as vibrant as you see in Samsung phones.4. Sound, you will surely enjoy the sound on this phone. It's loudspeaker is really great and you won't feel any issues within hearing sounds at full volume too.5. UI - EMUI is seriouslly kiddish, the icons and even the interface is not that great. But I am using NOVA launcher which makes me feel the same like previous phone.6. Charging speed is unbelievable and if charges your complete phone in approx 1 hour.So what does a person need in today's flagship phone is best camera, super battery life and fast charging, this all things are bundled in p30 pro. iPhone X series lacks with fast charging, good battery life and not great camera when compared to this.Samsung S10 plus has poor battery life but good screen resolution when compared to this.Pixel 3xl has poor battery life and while playing games like pubg it effects a lot, hangs a lot and screen is averagr.OnePlus 6t is a good purchase against this only if your budget is not high.",1

5,"One day review :-Awesome phone. Awesome camera, awesome battery life, awesome almost everything. Only thing I don't like is that its fingerprint reader is not that accurate and face unlock sucks in low light conditions. Also app lock don't look good. Software of phone i.e. EMUI is waste.Other than this almost all aspects of device is so out of the world.Review after a month :-This phone is awesome and is best in all aspects. Whether you talk for battery or camera or overall performance. This phone beats all. Night cam is superb as well as hdr. Compared with oneplus 7 pro, iPhone x, Samsung s10 plus and note 9. It beaton all and stood tall. Oppo reno came near for zoom but clarity and color reproduction, no way near.Moon mode is simply awesome. And unbearable still.There are few drawbacks.Screen - why huawei chose full HD screen over 4k? Now phones are going to come with 8k. This make this phone cry in few years.No screen guard : all phones come with a additional screen protector. It's not tempered glass but still sufficient to save screen from scratches. Why huawei didn't give it?Updates - why huawei don't push updates globally at same time? All other manufacturers do. Like Samsung, oneplus.I got update after a month of release. And meanwhile 3 updates released. So my phone still lag behind.Accessories - as phone is not popular, accessories are not available like for other phones. No ads for the phone too and they won't sale anything like tempered glass or cover.Apart from above, this phone is beast. I love it. Best phone ever.",1
5,"Switched from iPhoneX but satisfied with the phone, fingerprint reader is very good, in dark face detection has little problem but all other things covers it. It is beneficial for me. Good performance, Quality product.",0
5,"I did loads of research before buying this phone and decided this was the perfect one for me. Having dual-SIM was an absolute must for me as I needed to combine my personal (Vodafone) and work (EE) SIMs in one device. There's lots of conflicting information on various sites which claim to sell the dual version but don't. I actually checked the model number for this one with Huawei and they confirmed it for me, and it's the best price on the market. Great delivery time over Christmas period too.",1
5,Was looking for something that would be as good as the Nokia lumia 1020 and Nokia don't have anythingThis is the first time I've had a different make to Nokia in many years and I am impressed with the quality of the phone and the camera time will tell if it will last as long,0
4,Good camera (switch off ai ASAP). After having a Samsung s9 I have to say Samsung are way easier to use. Much more intuitive.  The camera isn't as good as its made out to be. More mp than the Samsung but the s9 take smore natural looking snaps. I took some of the best pics with a 2mp nikon  years ago so mega pixels are not everything.Nice to have a zoom. Battery life very good but I don't feel its  a phone i like much. Samsung do it better and if they match the price and camera I'd switch back.,1
4,"Dual SIM card. Performance excellent. Even though the software is Huawei's own, it's still very good some apps are even better than Google's vanilla version.Update on 10 March 2019:The latest software upgrade has messed up few usability aspects of the software. And the internet data connection both wifi and 3G get disconnected when kept idle for some time. Due to that WhatsApp calls do not get connected when others call.",1
5,Battery life is unreal on this thing and the rear facing camera is so good. Coming from IPhone I didn't realise what I was missing.Important thing for people to know is that the front facing camera isn't all that good for group selfies. Solo selfies come out good but group selfies always come out blurred or with poor quality.That comment though holds no weight on my overall happiness with this device! It's a great piece of kit and I'll be handing it down to my girlfriend once I can get my hands on a P30 (she can't wait),0

3,"Sadly, I have to agree with the review from user Giacomo Vannucchi.Initially, my P20 Pro turned out to be THE best phone I had ever purchased, along with exceptional battery life of several days instead of having to stick it on charge overnight, every night - like ALL my phones prior to this, such as the iPhone 6/6 Plus/iPhone 7, Samsung S6/S7/S8, etcetera - even when they were brand new out of the box, still had to be charged daily. As for the P20, it often lasted days even when constantly streaming music through Deezer/Spotify/YouTube.The fantastic dual cameras made for some awesome, high quality photo's as well.The speed and reaction times were great, and the biometric fingerprint scanner worked flawlessly (unless your finger was wet for example, which is completely understandable).Overall, it ""was"" a fantastic phone, the emphasis being on the word ""was"". Sadly, I no longer feel that way :(The phone now often takes several attempts to get into using fingerprint scanner even though I have, on several occasions, rescanned my prints. No help whatsoever.Secondly, just like Giacomo, apps randomly close on me for no apparent reason, which can get infuriating after a while.Next, again like the other user, the GPS keeps needing recalibration. Phone is also, as stated, extremely slippery, and slides off most surfaces with way too much ease. Turning off the vibration function when texts/calls arrive has not helped fix this.Luckily I have avoided cracking the screen - YET. It's bound to happen soon.I also have the same issues with it (the phone) having what I would call random volume levels, which often seem inconsistent.Soooooo many little issues adding up now, that I am starting to despise using this phone. I can appreciate I am in the minority with the issues being experienced, but this phone has gone from being ""The Best Phone Ever"" in my eyes, to one of the worst. I have to charge it daily now too.Never been so disappointed in a phone, mainly because it was so good to use when I first got it. I don't have lots of apps to bloat the phone, just my banking app, Spotify and Deezer, Expedia for booking holidays, and WhatsApp. I have installed no others.Most people are not going to experience these issues so I wouldn't worry too much, but for me personally, I am disappointed in Huawei's P20 Pro.",1
3,"Annoying things with my #Huawei #P20:- most apps accidentally close while I'm typing on the Google keyboard. It never happened to me before, not even with P10.- GPS has to be recalibrated. In general it is not performing as good as iPhone.- Unknown gestures activate hidden feature that I don't understand and  I'm not able to replicate. This in general is an issue of wanting to add too many features.- Phone falls from every surface even if it didn't ring. It's too slippery. My screen is broken in two places. I have to buy a case, which I never had to do before for any of the phones I had in the past.- volume headphones are too low, then saddenly you are able to put them at max volume, not sure how,and after a while it automatically reduce volume again.",1

2,"I bought this phone in place of an iPhone as it was cheaper, had a brilliant camera and apparently all the Apps I used most were availablebin Android form.This was one of the worst mistakes I've ever made- and to his credit, the guy in the shop did try to point that out. To my shame I didn't listen.So what's the problem?Yes,the camera is pretty good, but the difference between it and an iPhone or iPad camera in no way makes up for its other deficiences.I've got used to the idea that I can't use some of my Bluetooth devices anymore (scales, music device, hands free gizmo for car) as it just won't pair with them, even although they are new.And today it's decided it won't use my house WiFi either.And the Apps?.The Android versions just don't work anything like as well. Headspace in particular is fantastic on OS, but the Android version keeps crashing.If you are tempted over to Android by this phone. ... Just dont!",1

The finger print scanner and face regognition work 100X more responsively than any other phone I've used.",1
5,I’m a hardened iPhone user of 10 years.. but I was looking to upgrade after the iPhone X was released.. and couldn’t see anything very attractive.. but then I spotted this phone and made the leap. Well the SIM card matched so I was back on BT Wi-fi calling as we don’t have cell net coverage. The difference I noticed was the vast amount of choice in the settings. Compared to the Apple experience I’m allowed to delve deep into the settings and set the phone up to what I want. Boy oh boy when I look at my girlfriends iPhone 8 and then mine.. the difference is startling. I have a 40meg camera as well and so on the strength of the picture quality I sold my DSLR Nikon camera and felt good,1
5,"Screen -This Full HD plus screen is good. Fairly crisp and fairly vibrant. The size of screen is 6.1 inches diagonally.. This is a AMOLED screen (AMOLED screens produce darker blacks when compared to LCD screens) .Build Quality-Very good. In par with The latest Samsung, Apple phones and Google Pixel phone. Non removable back.It's noticeably lighter in weight  than the latest Galaxy series.Design-Lovely, sleek design. Still has a front mounted finger-print scanner which is very practical. This does not impact on the looks. Very practical too, so you can always unlock the phone from the front.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of some other phones.But then its in par with the Samsung Galaxy S9 series and Iphone X. Has no headphone jack, like the latest iPhones (why, oh why?)-unfortunately looks like the lack of headphone jack is an ongoing trend.The call quality is good. No issues encountered.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag at all. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. However, some android phones get marginally slower after about 6 months of use, and the Huawei, is no exception.EMUI is heavily skinned, so if you like a pure Google experience like on the Pixel phone, that would not be there.6GB RAM is there, and that is more than adequate.Added features-Micro SD slot is NOT available to expand memory .But inbuilt 128GB storage is just about adequate for loads of photos etc, as well as a lot of movies if you fancy.This phone is  water and dust (IP67) resistant.Cameras-This is the crowning glory of the phone. Huawei have really come forward with a really great and innovative camera (Samsung, I think you have a real competitor here!) Very good triple 40MP+ 20MP+ 8MP lens back camera.Brilliant photos in good daylight. Brilliant low light photos, and probably the best photos I have seen taken by a camera.The cameras are Leica branded. The front camera is good a single 24MP camera. It takes great selfies. I feel they are among the best selfies taken from any phone. The quality is actually immediately apparent.Guarantee-Huawei has 2 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. But then it has to be bought through an authorised reseller. However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon prime, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-A big 4000 mAH battery. There is a quick charge function, which charges the phones upto 58% in 30 minutes.Operating System-Runs Android 8.1 (Oreo) out of the box , but the Huawei’s  version of Android (EMUI 8.0)  may not be everyone’s cup of tea though. For starters, there is no app drawer, similarly to  the iphone. Some app icons looks a bit immature. The OS is very customizable, unlike iphones.There is machine learning, which can be helpful, but at this stage it’s a bit of gimmick. Maybe, few years later, we would see the true potential.Security features-Fingerprint sensor- very accurate. Nothing extra-ordinary here though.Colour-It currently comes in Midnight Blue, Titanium Gray, Mocha Brown, Pink Gold. Most UK sellers only have the Titanium Grey version.Price-Currently goes at RRP £799, and this is a bit cheaper when compared to the S9 plus.Final words-Great all rounder. Notable exclusions are a headphone jack as well as no memory card slot to expand memory. However, the camera trumps the current competition, and the front mounted finger print scanner is practical. I would recommend this phone definitely!",1

4,"I've had the phone almost a week now and been doing a lot of testing of the camera.I take a lot of photos so the review is mostly about the camera quality.In fact it was the camera that was main reason to change from the iPhone to Huawei.After taking a lot of photos in the iPhone and Huawei and comparing I can say the Huawei camera definitely is noticeably better than the iPhone 7 Plus camera.The Huawei's real WOW factor is its low light performance - which simply blows the iPhone camera out the water!The Huawei can take acceptable photos in light that would leave the iPhone snapping a blank black image.Last night I even took a photo in moonlight - and it wasn't even a bright full moon!  I've uploaded a crop of the image.  It has been enhanced in the camera to increase brightness and again Photoshop - pushing up the exposure.  Not an exciting photo but amazing given the only light was the moon's light.The night mode is not perfect - its not as sharp as in the daylight and does need some light!The other thing I've noticed is the Huawei seems to have better dynamic range.  So it can cope better with extreme light and dark in the same image.  For example an indoor shot of a darkish room with a bright window.  With the iPhone the window is overexposed and just one big white mass.  The Huawei the window is bright but still there is some image.  And yet the dark areas are also exposed acceptably well.Thirdly there is a greater level of detail in the Huawei images - despite being 10 megapixels vs the iPhone's 12 megapixels.I've uploaded some sample images of a field nearby - both are 100% crops of a larger image.  The darker one is the Huawei.  I notice Huawei does slightly underexpose compared to the iPhone.  Not sure how the images will look once uploaded to Amazon but the difference can be seen in the detail in the grass and trees.The Huawei is a 40 megapixel sensor and its not just a marketing gimmick.  I've uploaded 100% crops of 2 photos - 10 megapixel resolution upscales to 20.  And the same photo downscaled from 40 to 20 megapixels.  The 40 megapixel downsample clearly has more detail and is sharper.  Most of the time 40 megapixels is overkill.  But if you plan to print a large canvas - say 40 * 30 inches - the 40 megapixel image will print much better.So far the main issues with the camera are:1) Over sharpening - sometimes the image is over sharpened and looks a very unnatural.  I wish there was a setting to lower the amount of sharpening.  Switch to Pro mode reduces the over sharpening but Pro mode is broken in the 3X zoom ( see later comment ).  I've uploaded a crop of a photo showing the phone's tendency to over sharpen - especially in lower light ( for example when taking an early morning/late evening photo )2) Master AI is often a very over the top with its enhancing of images.  I generally leave it off but its personal preference.  You may enjoy that over processed look.  In some situations it looks great - sunsets for example. Its worse in situations where you know what colour things are meant to be.  Most of us know grass is not a bright luminescent green colour - so when the camera takes a photo of a field that looks like it should be an alien landscape it looks terrible.3) Using the zoom at 3 or more times has led to a higher number of blurred images than with the iPhone's zoom lens.  Mostly its fine and I think its due to camera shake which is worse with higher zoom levels.  The iPhone has no optical stabilising on the zoom lens and supposedly the Huawei does - so I'm surprised about the camera shake.  Above 1/60 second most 3X images are fine.  Below 1/40 second there's more blurred photos than keepers.  And I would I have fairly steady hands and did my tests on a still day.4) Some focussing issues - I had problems with it focussing with the zoom lens on my dog.  I'm not too sure why at the moment.5) The ""lossless"" zoom mode is on a par with re-sizing the 3X optical zoom in Photoshop.  Its not lossless!  But you'd not notice if you are just using the images for the Internet - where its quality is perfectly good.  If you are printing out an enlargement then its not lossless.6) It looks great but is very slippy!  It easily slides off surfaces which are not completely horizontal.  For example it almost slipped off my sofa arm but I caught it in time.  I guess a case is essential!One thing I have discovered is that Pro mode can produce better toned down colours and sharpening - a more natural look.  Still enhanced but not so wildly so.  Generally I prefer Pro mode even if I don't change any Pro level settings.Except however if I am using the 3X zoom.  Which in Photo mode uses the optical telephoto lens only and produces nice sharp shots.However the 3X zoom in Pro mode uses all 3 cameras to produce a combined zoomed image - essentially a ""digital"" zoom rather than optical zoom.I've uploaded with this review 2 photos of a weather station in a nearby garden.  These are 100% crops of a larger image.  Its pretty clear the Photo mode 3X is much sharper than the Pro mode 3XAt first I thought my camera was broken or there was a bug in the software the images are that much softer.But I have contacted Huawei support and this was their reply:""we inform you that the PRO Mode uses the three cameras at the same time and specially the one with 40MP. This one has an aperture of 1.8 and the the telephoto lens has 2.4, but this mode uses the aperture of the lens with 40MP not only the telephoto. ""Which I took to mean that the Photo mode zoom uses just the optical lens.The Pro mode zoom uses the optical lens, combined with the non-zoom lens and the black and white lens.Which in fact gives worse results virtually every time than just using the optical zoom of the Photo mode!So for 3X zoom its best to avoid Pro mode if you are really picky about image quality - which I am!Overall I'm pleased with the phone.  Looks good.  Screen nice and sharp with good natural colours and works fine in bright sunshine.Speedy - no significant lag, though not quite as fast as the iPhone in some situations.Its real killer feature is the night mode.  I've still to fully test this but so far it blows the iPhone out the water for night shots!If I had the power to do so I would:1) Have a setting for less image sharpening.2) Make the 3X telephoto use optical zoom only in Pro modeIf anyone has any questions regarding the camera side of things please ask.*** Update ****I've added 4 more photos.Another 3X zoom ""Photo"" mode and a 3X zoom ""Pro"" mode 100% crop of a sign ( exiting subject! )Also a 3X zoom resized to 5X in Photoshop elements.  And 5X zoom in the camera.I've found sometimes resizing in Photoshop produces better results than the cameras 5X zoom.  But other times its the other way round.Either way its not a lossless zoom equivalent to an optical 5X zoom.Ignore the images of the bridge demonstrating the 40 megapixel downsizing vs 10 megapixel upsizing - because Amazon have resized and reduced the quality its made the images look the same whereas the 40 megapixel looks much sharper in reality.  But despite attempts to delete them from I've not been able to.",1

5,"This device is in its own class. Having owned both Samsung s9plus and P20 pro I can see how Huawei stands out in all areas. Let's start, first the sound it does come with Dolby Atmos though you might not notice this yes it does come with Atmos and stereo speakers that have a better base and rich sound. Second, the UI is much simple and easy to use and if you are moving away from Apple iPhone, believe me, you won't miss it. Third, the screen offers OLED super blacks and has less reflection compared to other screens hence offers much more immersive experience. The battery is way better than S9plus and iPhone with a full day of extensive usage you still get 1.5 days out of the phone. With normal usage and 30 minutes, full charge you can get 2.3 days out of this or if you turn on ultra battery mode on when you are 2% left I got 3 hours with navigation out of it. The notch on the top gives a feeling of a larger screen for some strange reason I like however you have the option to turn the notch off.Ok now lets come to the camera, there the AI offered by Huawei has no comparison as all your pics will come out dramatic and so professional that you won't believe yourself. This is due to the pixel perfect intelligence inside and also the 40-megapixel resolution encapsulated to 10 megapixel which offers a uniquely clear and widest gamut range for colours. The AI takes the photos from good to dramatically jaw-dropping. Night photography problems are thing of the past with this phone as it can take handheld photos without blur at the night. It is indeed a jump that all mobile photographers were waiting for a leap forward. Here are some sample pics were taken at 5x or 3x zoom the macro ones.After G8 plus back 4 years I got sold with Huawie's photography algorythym and it seems they have mastered it with this phone. Dont think of iPhone or S9Plus if you want a good camera phone not saying they are bad but this gives you that edge of not using snapseed or any other software to boost your pics. Hope this helps...",1
5,"I am very impressed with this phone, this is my first Huawei P20 pro and I could not be happier, the display is excellent with a beautiful OLED screen as well as this the processor is extremely quick and it is so easy to navigate. It has all the apps you ever need with the play store, the best feature I would say is the camera which is extremely detailed and has a fantastic zoom function which unparalleled to any other phone. I also love the low light feature which is really convenient when in a poor lit area as previously my Samsung and iPhone phone really struggled to get a decent photo.The sound quality is excellent and it has all the compatible ports, with 128 GB of storage you don't require an SD card at all and it is ample data. Furthermore the design of the phone is super sleek and I love the dark metallic blue colour at the back which is sturdy and makes the phone easy to hold. What is brilliant also is that you can easy travel with the phone, having dual sim allows you to have two numbers and it is very simple to use it.I am definitely convinced this brand is market leading and is a consider for one of the best phones of 2018 given the user interface, design, camera, long battery life and the AI technology!",1
5,"I was a Apple everything guy and also to be honest have tried nearly every mobile out there from Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, HTC, LG to name a few, but since purchasing the Huawei Pro 128GB  (6RAM) I am totally blown away. admittedly with other mobiles that I previously owned I struggled to transfer or keep my contacts and other stuff that was important to the running off everyday requirements from one mobile to another. Not this time! this is the most easiest mobile to use and very powerful and quick, the features that come with this mobile is what you will need and use, also you must as a given get the Huawei GT Watch as this complements the Pro 20 perfectly. Not as expensive as the Apple or Samsung big players but more user friendly  and just as powerful, worth every penny.",1
1,"Worst phone I've had in 5 years. Was using a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge before this and have been disappointed pretty much since day one. Instantly regretted letting go of that extra Samsung finesse. The famous p20 pro camera is a joke. Push notifications just don't happen. The battery life is of course an improvement, but only a marginal one. 2018 Huawei flagship feels cheap and outdated in comparison to 2015 Samsung. Fortunately I can early upgrade next month. I'll be ditching Huawei for good and will probably take a cheaper deal with and another older Samsung, probably galaxy s8. Even my old bright green iPhone 5C was a better smartphone experience than this...",1
5,"Amazing phone, takes time to figure it all out as been an iPhone user for many years.Camera is fantastic.Only criticism is some apps do not work as 'not supported in this country' regardless of if the app is an UK one. Thankfully these are not important apps so not overly bothered",0

2,Impressive camera.APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE.,0
5,"I've had Samsung phones all the way back to the Galaxy S4. So changing to a brand not aswell known in someways i did have my doubts. The phone has been brilliant, no issues of slowdowns/overheating to report at all. Did consider going with another smartphone with the latest SD845 but this Kirin chip is very quick and you'll hardly notice the difference. So to cut a long story short it's better than the S8+ in every way, really happy to have dual speakers back, better sound and improved battery performance. Photo's are just brilliant on this smartphone aswell.Cons's for some people are no wireless charging/no official Corning Gorilla Glass 5 - I never used wireless charging before on the S8 so has no impact on me. The phones already been dropped by accident when in it's case from at least 5 foot and the is no damage to report at all.All round happy on all fronts!!",1

5,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review.So, having had devices from the major android manufacturers for a number of years, moving to Huawei was always going to be a bit of a leap into the unknown. On paper, the device looks and sounds fantastic, however, I was still sceptical. Nonetheless, I've now had the device for a number of weeks and through some extensive use feel I can provide a pretty comprehensive verdict.Overall, I have been immensely impressed, the quality of the device, the power of the camera and the stamina of the battery are all stand out features.For me the most positive elements of the device are (in no particular order): - Screen quality (I'd certainly argue that it's as good as the competitors) - Battery (I reckon 2 days of use should be achievable with moderate use) - Camera (Without a doubt the best camera I've ever used on a phone, the results are spectacular, particularly using Night Mode) - Build quality (It might look fragile, but it's holding up very well, despite heavy use - although a case is necessary, like all other flagships these days).Some of the areas where I feel the device could improve (again, in no particular order): - I didn't think I'd miss wireless charging too much, but, I do - The software isn't quite as polished as other OEM's - either stick with stock android or put the time and effort into making the software seamless - Some particular software quirks, in particular, issues with Android Auto displaying weirdly, no Google Play Music sound through Android Auto, limited Always Display capability, difficulties with Nova Launcher and Widgets, challenges with Google Assistant and Google Pay, etc. - Bloatware - not too much of it, but still more than I had expected (and I'm not sure if much of it is too useful!)Ultimately, it's so easy to see why this device is so highly regarded in the media - it's a really solid effort and I really believe it could convince people to move away from the more established manufacturers. Whilst there are areas for improvement, these are minor and can quite easily be rectified through software updates.I would definitely recommend this product.",1
4,"I bought this phone to have always available my 2 sims that normally use because I was tired to bring with me two different phone. My previous phone was an iPhone 7 and there is not much difference between iOS and Android (anyway, I prefer iOS). This Huawei is fast for what I do: whatsapp, social, navigation, emails, payments via google pay and good photos. The display is good, but during the sunny days, sometimes it's difficult to read on it. The battery life (more or less one day) could be better.",1

I'm so happy I made the change.Battery life lasts so much longer, camera and features are so much better and I'm still learning new tips and tricks everyday to make the most of this phone. The phone is cheaper, it's a little slower with apps but that isn't the end of the world.The location of the fingerprint reader is much easier.",1
5,"Perfect. Great work phone due to dual sim. Best phone I have had. Camera great. Video is not the best but 100% and more worth the price. You do now have to give Huawei your info unlike Samsung and iPhone. Can set up as anonymous.I would like to add, you don't have to use fingerprint or facial recognition, they are only options. Always keep your cameras covered when not in use (great tip for any smart device)",1
5,This product is amazing looks brilliant and I love the way I have three different types of security a really accurate Face ID and brilliant fingerprint recognition and if all fails I still have my password hat an astonishing blend of apple and android into one phone I’ve converted from apple to android and it makes transition easy as well as quick.  This is the best phone on the market at its price,1
5,"What a lovely surprise. Don't listen to negative comments. I think for this price you cannot go wrong with this phone. From built quality to the ease of use, it is the best in its class. Battery lasts a day or day and a half for good amount of usage. Gosh why did I wait and wasted money on iPhone. In fact iPhone seems too inferior compare to this basic model. I'm happy with my choice and so would you be. Good luck",1
5,"This is by far the best mobile I have ever used. The delivery came on schedule and everything was as it should be when the packaging was opened. The set up was virtually seamless, which is a first for me. I am an I.T numbskull, so, for this to go right from the outset was a revelation to me. The account set up was so simple and the transfer of contacts etc. from my previous Sony Experia was lightening quick. Who the hell would want to spend over £1000 on a phone when this companies range is so good. I love it.",1

1,"A total garbage, useless EMUI, i really think the operation system is made in a hurry because there is too many bugs, the responsiveness of touch is also garbage, it has at least 0.5s for the phone to response my actions, and the screen is nothing compare to Samsung, the colour that it displays is too distorted to show the true colour. Basically this phone is only worth its camera, other than the camera, it is a total garbage.",1
5,"as a low tech, keen photographer iphone owner  on a budget this was a big step , battery life could be slightly better - but incredibly fast charge so its not a huge issue , you arent going to get the same quality camera found on the P20 pro but the cost difference ought to tell you that , what this does offer is very very good all round performanceconsidering what its capable of and functions offered it was beautifully easy to set up ( if i can do it anyone can ) pretty much everything is customisable and its very slick while still being user friendly would be fine from anyone from teen to granny (if shes a bit of a silver surfer )they could easily put an extra £50 on the price and it would still be worth itreally really pleased with this",1

Hence, this phone is a good backup should there be a need, if IOS fall down, as I don’t use Android Phone regularly before now.  This phone Huawei P20 Lite make me to want to learn how to use and familiar with android phone. Functional is good overall I will give it 4.5star rating when considering the quality and price compare with similar named phones without dual SIM card functions.",1
1,"Awful camera quality and pictures - they look like they have this ugly filter on them. I will definitely stick to iPhones. The battery life is surprising, I have to recharge my iPhone 3/4x more than the Huawei P20 but at least it has a decent camera and the text is nicer",1
5,"i've been using iphone 6 before i bought this. and i can assure you this is a new fantastic experience i ever had. the fast charging made my life even easier as i frequently use my phone to read news, pdf, slides & social media etc. the screen is superb as i watched Netflix on it. sound even more awesome, living in double room you can listen to music clearly only have to put the volume at medium. it has 2 speaker which is great for watching youtube videos. camera? what else i have to say? its leica and it really meet my requirement. dont forget to try all the specs design for the camera, you are going to love it. value for money? as a student i always find myself struggle with financial but this one will worth the money. dont buy new iphone because it appear a ""downgrade"" as they call to others. this is whole new different experience. although, the face recognition might not function as good as iphone. but who bother? the fingersensor still working efficiently even you touch it after washing your hand. also, my asian hand is a lil smaller, yet still convenience to use one handed. bottom line, ideal for heavy use (emails, social media, youtube, netflix, slides & pdf), have not experience any lagging, sound & camera beyond my expectation, recommended for sport person like me who spent a lot time outside fighting those wet weather condition.",1

5,"1st of all, this is the review of the UK version of the amber Sunrise 512gb dual SIM version.Beware of ""international"" versions for the same price. They are often single SIM and should be sold for a lot less than the 1099 UK price.The main reason for this phone being great is the camera. It really is that good. 50x zoom that's actually clearer than an S10 at 8x zoom. Pictures in virtually no light that appear with colour as if it was daytime.512gb is a brilliant amount of storage and essential if you do plan to use the dual SIM facility as you will loose access to the nm card option.The rest of the phone however is basically the same as the mate 20 pro. Same cpu, same screen, same storage (if you get the 128gb version) both have reverse wireless charging, in display fingerprint and wide angle lens.If you are not too fussed about the camera the cheaper mate 20 pro would be a better idea.Battery life is incredible as ever. Thanks to the sometimes aggressive Huawei power management the battery will last and last. For a comparison, I left an s10 plus and p30 Pro together at home while I went to work. 10 hours later when I got home, the s10 plus was down to 80%, the p30 Pro was still at 100%! Amazing.The UI takes some getting used to, especially if like me you have always been a galaxy user. ItEmui doesn't feel quite as polished as other android versions.Expect to see the p30 Pro at number 1 in All phone ranking charts in 2019 until the mate 30 Pro comes along in october :)I personally would get the 512gb p30 Pro as its just a bit more expensive than the 128gb version. Unfortunately it's very hard to find at the moment.The speaker on the p30 Pro is not quite as good as other phones which use the top speaker for a stereo effect. As the p30 Pro only has the bottom speaker you do tend to notice the weaker audio.The best camera and battery with brilliant  storage for me make this the #1 phone of 2019",1
4,Very impressed with this phone which was purchased for my wife.I'm currently using an iPhone 6 but would have little hesitation in replacing it with one of these when it the iPhone goes the way of the Dodo.Screen and camera are very impressive. Dual SIM slot is extremely handy for a Micro SD card to bump up the storage.,0
5,"This is the best smartphone I've ever had. Previously I have had an HTC, Samsung and two Sony phones. This beats them all.  Usually after a couple of weeks I'm griping about something - either connectivity, picture or sound quality etc, but this is ticking all the boxes.  The only thing with the face recognition is that if the light is a bit dimmer it takes a couple of goes to open.  It's really easy to use and I haven't noticed a different in the EMUI.  The finger print recognition is easy to use and great for my banking apps.  The screen might not be amoled but I have a glass screen cover and it's really responsive.I would definitely recommend this phone.",1
5,"Having never bought a Huawei before and used a Nokia Lumina 1020 for four years as I was impressed with the specs of the phone for only £230. I was not disappointed.This phone is an excellent smartphone with android capability which makes life so much easier! Charging is super fast, about a 1% a minute which is extremely handy and the 4G network with EE is extremely impressive. Good Points:1. Very simple and easy to use, personalisation is fantastic as you can truly change the menu to meet your needs.2. Organisation is brilliant, it is very easy to find which setting you are looking to amend and the drop down bar is brilliant.3. Bluetooth and Hotspot connections work brilliantly.4. Haven't found an app that doesn't work and be bale to scroll through and open multiple apps and tabs in an identical format to the Amazon Tablet is brilliant.Only negatives would be that the alarm isn't very loud and fingerprint sensor doesn't always recognise my fingerprint - you can then just use the pin to unlock.Overall very pleased with my first android phone, have recommend to others and since bought a Huawei watch as well. It also comes with an earphone jack and headphones!",0
1,"What a waste of money this phone was but thanks to Amazons excellent money back guarantee I was quickly reimbursed. The overall quality was xxxx, the case was rubbish as was the rest of the phone and when you compare it to another famous one also made in China it just shows what the quality control is and means. The cost compared to my iPhone 7 was quite a bit cheaper but just remember the old saying, you only get what you pay for.",1

After comparing this one and the Samsung s9 this won on spec and I'm so pleased I got it. The camera quality is amazing and battery life is superb. Normally I'd be charging my phone twice a day but this lasts me 2 days sometimes with heavy usage. The superfast charging is brilliant as well. You won't be disappointed!!,1
4,I like it fro the performance and qualitybut now at the market we have better nodels for less price,0
4,"I received this Huawei P20 lite as part a review program in return for an unbiased review. The Huawei P20 lite is the cheapest option out of the P20 range, it's big brothers being the P20 and P20 Pro. But it still packs a punch in it's midrange world! The P20 lite is perfectly capable of everyday tasks, like Web browsing, social media and some “lite” gaming.I was also impressed by the build quality with its glass body and metal trim, gives it that premium look and feel. Battery life was good, not great but with around 3.5 / 4 hours of screen on time, which is fairly standard now. Huawei supplies you with a turbocharger which managed to take me from 5% to 100% in 1 hour and 31 minutes. That is great news as you'll need to top it up if you're a heavy user.Now let's talk about the camera, which at this price point and being the only one in the p20 range not to receive Leica optics/branding, the camera is good! Pictures come out  sharp and with great detail. The only let down is on the video side of things. No OIS (optical image stabilisation) or EIS (electronic image stabilisation), so your video will only be as steady as your hand, although maybe that's too much to ask from a £300 smartphone. The front facing camera is a very capable 16mp shooter, it includes those all important bokeh shots. It's a software bokeh but it seems to work quite nicely, I have been pleasantly surprised with both cameras on this device.The P20 lite has a rear mounted fingerprint scanner, making it different from its bigger brother but also giving more screen to body ratio. Although once I had set up the face unlock feature, I hardly used the fingerprint scanner. The face unlock was fast and efficient, only struggled in the dark. If you turn up the screen brightness to full, that seems to help.The notch! Love it or hate it's here and to be honest I think it's grown on me over the past two weeks of testing. I actually like having that extra space for notifications and if you really don't like it, you can change it. By going into the settings and making either side of the notch black if you so desired. Now one small problem is that this is  not an AMOLED screen, just IPS LCD. So the screen isn't 100% black and yes you can still see the notch. Didn't bother me as I just left the notch on.The Huawei P20 lite is amazing with a big display in a small device, the phone is easy to hold and light too. I was very impressed with the camera and overall build and design but ( there has to be a but..) the user interface! The EMUI skin that Huawei use just seems childish to me and no matter what theme I used I could not change the settings menu. The CPU, the Kirin 659 is over a year old now and has been used in many cheaper devices from Huawei and its subsidiaries. Multitasking was a problem, it just couldn't keep up with what I was asking it to do.Well what can I say, the Huawei P20 lite is great, a phone with that must have 2018 specification, the notch! And at a very affordable price tag, if it just had a bit more power and a better user interface I could maybe get along with it. Would I recommend this phone? Yes! To someone looking for a good deal on a notch device or maybe save up and buy yourself a P20.",1
5,good value,0
4,"The item wasn't dual SIM as described, so I ended up returning it (although I'm still waiting on the refund from Amazon).Camera is decent but not as amazing as Huawei would like us to believe - for example if you want a camera that's good for snapshots, I think the Pixel and S10 are better devices. The 5X zoom is fun but the quality of images from that particular sensor leaves a lot to be desired in comparison to the main lens.Battery life is excellent, and Supercharge means that even if you drain the battery the device can be brought back to 100% in no time.The software is not my cup of tea - it seems poorly designed and just doesn't have the same aesthetic charm as Samsung's new OneUI for example. It's functional, but it also has some power saving annoyances and irritations with obfuscated menu systems - for example, turning off power management for Google Photos (to enable background uploads) requires going to 'settings...battery...app launch' and making sure all the toggles for Google Photos are blue. To enable lockscreen multimedia controls you have to turn off authentication in the Face Unlock menu, rather than the lockscreen or notifications menu.The fingerprint scanner works well but it has to shine an incredibly bright light to read your prints, and also has a notification that appears whenever you move the phone. Both of these things make me concerned about screen burn over time.Overall this is a nice device, but I don't think it's as special as they might say, and I certainly don't think it's worth £899.",1
5,I'm really impressed with the phone. I find it very easy to use. I have been used to Galaxy phones previously and this is not dissimilar. I would definitely recommend to anyone. It's a matter of taste really. Battery life is fantastic when compared to my Galaxy.,1

3,"I am so disappointing with the camera that I felt inclined to give it one star.  ""Take pictures that amaze"" ""Take amazing shots with the help of the powerful 16MP dual lens camera and a range of visual effects, including wide aperture and the Bokeh effect""  I cannot believe that Huawei have the audacity to say that.  It's probably the worst camera I have used in all the phones I have had.  For dull conditions not worth taking a snap and when I have I have to edit and adjust the contrast and brightness.  Fortunately I still have an old Nokia 40mp camera with the grip so I figure if I wanted to take some serious photos, I would have to cart that around with me.As for the phone itself, I bought it because the current network is almost non existent in my area now and so I have registered with another network much improved but have kept both networks, hence the reason for buying a dual sim.  I downloaded and printed off the manual in case I was missing something but was no help.It is an attractive phone, very slim and I like the fact you can use the finger print to use it as the constant pushing of the button at the side and putting in a passcode was getting tiresome.  It does seem a bit busy which I am getting used to as my last phone was a Windows 10 phone.All in all would be a really nice phone were it not for the camera.  I should have watched some of the video reviews and perhaps waited and got the Pro 20 but that was another £100.Edit: sadly another ""flaw""  The default SMS app will limit standard SMS's to 160 text characters; this setting cannot be modified so you will be charged at whatever your provider charges, in my case Virgin 50p a time.",0
5,"For the money (I paid £229) this is an incredible phone. Looks like a flagship model, camera is excellent with superb bokeh (blurred background) effect. Face unlock and fingerprint unlock are instant and screen is very good quality.  Very zippy in use with no lagging. Battery easily lasts a day with heavy use.I had 4 Samsung phones prior to this and the Huawei is in a different league and was actually cheaper than my last Samsung.  Also much better than both my daughters phones, they have an iPhone 6 and an iPhone 7. Why does anybody buy an overpriced iPhone???Highly, highly recommended!!!!",1
5,If you know about phones read this... This a fantastic little sister of P20 Pro.. Its features are accessible. And unlike others things you will use.. The camera is still fantastic... Even dual lenses.. A couple of things I would suggest.. Alter the display to Huge.. And large on text and screen(maximum). You can still show 6 apps deep per screen and much easier to type. Then feels much bigger.. While being compact.. The next thing is the dual aim which P20 Pro does not support although if you use a memory card it is either or.. It uses the same slot in the phone.. Another point no much a problem but I was surprised.. The fitment on Huawei phones jack plug is different to the standard so you may want to purchase an extra cable.. The dual account option is fantastic you can set the phone up for someone else to use without them seeing anything of yours or your private stuff.. Having the fingerprint pad is better than the front.. In my opinion. You can operate the navigation with it! When showing someone something without your fingers in the way.. The camera options are simple and are all on slide left and right on the screen so you can set it up so quickly without losing your shot.. All round its fantastic phone!! And bear in mind it's half the price of the slightly larger P20 Pro! Trust this buy one! Highly recommend it! 1 last thing.. Do not be disappointed when you buy glass protectors for the screen.. The screen has a slight curve and none of them fit well so just buy the cheapest.. Its not that bad you can't live with it.,1
5,"Now that this phone model is a few months old, and the price has come down, I decided to buy it to replace my old HTC phone.  After a few weeks use, I have to say I am very pleased. There is much that I really like, and although there are a couple of niggles, these are minor.Let’s start with what I really like…The battery life is very good. I’m probably a light/medium user – checking emails a few times a day, some web browsing, some social media use, a few photos per day, a few minutes listening to music in the gym, and a couple of phone calls per day. From a full charge first thing in the morning, I’m still having 70% charge remaining in the evening. And that’s with Bluetooth and GPS on all the time.The camera is good. I sometimes turn off the AI settings and automated portrait mode, since these can over process the photos for my liking and sometimes get the focusing wrong. But generally, the photos have well balanced exposure, good detail and accurate colour rendition. Likewise, the video – though I’ve yet to explore all the options, such as slow motion.The phone is fast - opening apps quickly, enabling quick scrolling, and downloading and uploading very quickly.Very good screen and sound. The phone also gives good sound with my Bluetooth earphones.Finger print reader and face recognition both work quickly and efficiently.Quick charging: I can quickly charge the phone in the morning before going to work. Note that the Super Charge charging needs the supplied charger and compatible cable; though, charging using normal chargers and cables is also reasonably fast.Large storage: although this phone doesn’t accommodate an SD card, it does have quite a bit of internal storage. The firmware takes up about 8GB, leaving about 120GB for apps, music, photos etc.And the not so good…This is a thin, slippery phone. A clear case is provided, and the screen has a thin screen protector beneath the even thinner screen protector that is placed on for shipping. However, I didn’t feel that either of these were sufficient, so I have replaced them with a new case (Spigen - Rugged Armor) and glass screen protector (OMOTON - Compatible Screen Protector for Huawei P20). These seem much better, and the case makes the phone much easier to grip and hold.Huawei’s software interface (the “EMUI”) is pretty easy to navigate, but it’s a bit clunky in places, and it seems to run a few functions I’m not interested in, such as pedometer data.  I spent a lot of time trying to turn off notifications from apps and features, only to find that they returned. I think this was because I also needed to reset them via other menus, though this all left me feeling a bit muddled. Fortunately, there are some good websites offering Tips and Tricks for using the phone.Overall, the niggles are minor, and I am really pleased with this phone.",1
5,Amazing,0
5,"Had the phone for a few days after purchasing on contract. It's bigger than I'm used to (S7 edge) but I'd read the spec and reviews before purchasing so would be unfair to say its too bigGood screen, great camera and really fast to use. Facial recognition works great but fingerprint sensor not as accurate taking a few tries.It's slippy so a case is a must to avoid dropping it by accident.Aside from Huawei using their own expansion slot instead instead of microsd and no headphone jack, struggling to find much wrong with it. Just need to get used to a slightly different layout than Samsung",1
5,"After reading so many negative reviews i regarding the P30 not being dual sim i thought i would leave a review. I have the standard P30 and it is defiantly Dual Sim. I have uploaded a photo to show this, top left of the photo shown by a red arrow shows 2 signal strengths and 2 provider details. I have 2 EE sims in my P30 while i am waiting for my old contract to end. I can receive calls to both numbers and receive texts. You can select which sim you want to default to for your data as well. In the sim slot holder it says sim and also nm which is for a nano memorry card if you wish to use one but it is also for a second nano sim (small sim). If you insert 2 sims and then go to settings - wireless & networks - dual sim settings you can alter the settings to suit your needs.With all that being said i love my P30. It is easy to use, the camera is the best camera i have ever had/seen on a phone (better than my nikon SLR!) and the style of the phone aesthetically is stunning. I was a little nervous going from the samsung s8+ to the P30 however i shouldn't have been. It is an amaizing phone and the free speaker for pre-order plus cheaper contract price have also been a great addition to the deal (£20 a month better off). Had the phone now for over a week and the speed of the phone is brilliant. The battery is usually at around 50% by the time i go to bed which is amazing as my Samsung had normally been on charge well before going to bed. In my opinion this phone is outstanding and worth every penny. I don't have the P30 pro as stated I have the P30 however have added a picture of the spec from the Huawei website stating the P30 pro is dual sim hope this helps.",1
5,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review. This is my fourth Huawei phone. Most recently I have had a P10 lite, and a P9 lite (the original one). So, the P20 lite was a logical choice. My P10 lite was a big advance on the P9 lite, which had a number of issues, not least a quite poor camera. Since the main selling point of this new phone was the camera, I was very interested to see what it was like. Initial impressions were good. The phone is solid, well built and has a premium look and feel. It is sleek, light and has an almost edge to edge screen. The OS works well, as you would expect. Emui takes a bit of getting used to, but adds value to the phone UI. The phone is really responsive and the screen is bright, feeling definitely like a premium phone. My old P9 lite was laggy and often did not respond to touch, but the P20 is fantastic.The camera was not that good in the P9 lite. Picture were a bit dark and fuzzy. The have fixed this in the P20 lite, which takes crisp, bright pictures. The shutter button has to be held to take a picture, not tapped, but the camera is fast and there is no delay between wanting to take a picture and the picture bring taken. I haven't explored all the different features of the camera yet. Needless to say, the are plenty to keep you occupied. WiFi signal is good, and I seem to get better mobile network coverage. My old phone had no signal indoors (we live in a poor reception area) but the P20 lite gets signal, albeit quite weak. NFC works much better than my P9 lite. It used to be really buggy, but they seem to fix it for the P10 lite. Bluetooth range seems a bit limited, and my phone keeps dropping connection in our car.  This is frustrating as you cannot reconnect the phone whilst driving (obviously).  Not sure if it is to do with range, interference or compatibility/software.Migration was a breeze, but there was interference between Google backup/recovery and the Huawei migration app. In the end, all the apps were transferred twice. As a result, it took a long time to set up. I also lost all of my downloaded music, but that may have been user error as I was not sure what I was doing. Now it is all done, it works great.Battery life could be better. If I am using it a lot, for social media etc, I need to recharge it during the day. I expect I could change some settings to conserve power, but it doesn't really bother me. I think my old P10 lite lasted better, but maybe I am just doing more with the P20 - I want to be using it all the time.All in all, the phone is beyond my expectations. Many friends and colleagues have commented on it, which is great. It really is a great device and comes highly recommended.I did get this phone at a reduce cost for review.  However, if it was no good, I would say so. I don't buy flagship phones as I cannot justify the cost.  So, I look for best value for money.  I have found the Huawei 'lite' range to be a great compromise between cost and quality/performance.",1
5,"Amazing. Been apple. IPhone user for years but they're products are rubbish these days, ie poor battery poor storage, poor camera and cost twice as much as this. Amazing value for money works UK on O2 no problem",0
5,"This is what happens when the folk at Apple spend too much time sitting back counting their cash rather than working in the development labs. I gave up Apple for Samsung and now for Huawei. Pound for pound this device is packed and stacked, face and finger recognition, 64gb, a fantastic camera and a sharp screen, brand new for less than £200 ! Get ready for the Chinese domination of our tech markets. I do have a silicon cover to protect it, that is a MUST for any phone. I heard that the Chinese might be tracking these devices to gather information about us......aren't all the big boys doing that ???? if someone is willing to buy information saying that I buy salad from Tesco, bananas from Sainsbury and that I get upset when Tottenham lose to Burnley (yes Burnley !!!!), then more fool them.",1
5,"Bought this phone in replace of my iPhone 6. It is quite large so I bought something to stick on the back so I can reach across the screen better but other than that it seems to be a great phone.I am a photographer so was very interested in the camera, only thing I'm not too keen on is that it's a tiny tiny bit slow, comparing with my previous phone that is.I use Snapchat a lot too and have had a few problems with that, i.e. SUPER slow at taking a photo, videos freeze towards the end but only for you, sometimes it cuts off around your head when using a filter.The storage is amazing compared to the iPhone6 I had so no complaints there.Love that it came with a case and one thing apple doesn't have is how much you can personalize the layout and theme on the phone.Very happy I spent all my savings on this haha",1
5,"A well priced mobile and easy to use.  Normally I would buy a Samsung as they are great phones, but decided to give the Huawei a go, based on price. The icons are different for a couple of them, but other than that it works well and has saved me money. Also the dual sim is great for operating 2 different accounts from the same phone.",1
4,"Only had the phone for a week. But have to say I am loving it. I paid £200 and yet it appears to perform better than the price tag wouldsuugest. The battery saving mode is pretty aggressive so had to not optimise for the app (fitbit), that I wanted to run in the background. But still get a full 24 hrs on a single charge.",1
5,does what it says on the package first phone that I had brought with out a binding contract shopped round and got a good sim deal that suited me changed from expensive apple phone and went android miles better good specs does everything that I need battery life superb.,0
5,"I've had various Android phones (from high-end HTC to lower-end WileyFox) and the Huawei P20 is brilliant value for money. I didn't have the budget to afford the newer version, and I was slightly worried that the older model wouldn't feel like a higher-end phone, but the style and performance certainly out-muscles the cost; great value for money!",0
5,"I got this phone on a really good deal from EE. It seems that one has to either be in luck(my case) or continuously browse for deals of the month. going from £43 with 10gig data and unlimited calls and texts to £59 a month in a space of a week!This Crystal blue is so beautiful! When the phone is out of its cover its like holding some form of memorising tactile object. It's so pleasant to hold.I've had 3 premium phones in the last 3 years. My main phone was a 7"" Huawei X2(not premium). That phone is a surfers dream. It's a Full HD screen. Text is very clear. It is very slim in thickness and looks great. In parallel to owning that phone I went through 2 LG phones, the G5, and the G6. Both phones had outstanding video capability. But I always just left them at home and took out my X2 as a lovely Phablet phone(proper Tablet/Phone) combo.So I was in 2 minds about this phone being even 6.5"". It's a lot narrower than the X2. But testing in the shop I could see the text was really sharp.I was dearly hoping to get a new Phablet that ""did it all"". The X2 camera was functional. Captured things but certainly no pop. The X2 forte was kindle and endless hours of surfing, plus a great YouTube experience. Other useful aspect of its size was I could test my video work and vet it for quality.I mention the X2 because I am a through and through phablet person.However, over the past 2 years since my LG G4 days, I just stopped taking photos and short videos.So this brings me to the cameras on this phone. One can go through loads of YouTube videos on the features of the P30 pro camera capabilities, but reviewers are not always 100% reliable. I usually go by the numbers. If there is enough differing opinion then I don't plunge in. Nearly all reviewers were truly amazed by the cameras on this phone.The zoom on this camera brings back the fun of photos and filming! I was a big fan of camcorders and their zooming functions.Zooming in on local birds is really fun! One has to hold the phone steady as you lose the shot, but once still there is no distortion .I started getting the wide angle lens from the LG G5. The first to bring it out. Now its a standard feature. So this phone has that too!8 Gig internal ROM memory! This is huge by today's standards! Even laptops don't always get 8gig internal memory.I'd love it if this could hook up to a laptop and switch operating systems and be able to do video editing. However, my full knowledge of the specs required might be lacking. Samsung have this feature nailed. So Huawei, if you reading this, get cracking on that feature.The screen size has amazed me. I bought a Samsung 10"" A6 tablet for those coffee shop moments to get the optimum experience.The first few days with my P30 I was completely satisfied with just surfing and typing(external keyboard) on it. The video experience is more amazing than you'd think. Netflix takes full advantage of the wide screen on some of their original shows. Seeing this extreme high quality end to end screen is truly impressive. One can just admire the clarity, never mind the content.Facial recognition is awesome if you've never used it. So convenient. I activated it without my glasses, but it has no problem if I have glasses on.Fingerprint scanner is really great too. The LG G6 had Fingerprint scanner on the back which was very practical. This is a scanner on the screen. It works really well. Setup requires a very detailed scan of your fingers. I'd recommend doing both thumbs and forefingers.The Fingerprint recognition can be used for secured apps too. Barclays don't do it but the natwest app does. So no more memorising passwords.Getting back to the shape and the all glass phone, it's such a cool object to hold. Even in the spigen clear case I got for it, it feels so comfortable in my hand. I'm used to a wider phone before so this feels really easy to hold. I've got medium sized hands. Sometimes I just hold it. The weight feels really balanced.So if you are a big phone fan you can switch to this before trying to get hold of the 7"" version like the Huawei Mate 20 Max. I'd imagine the P30 Mate Max will be a pretty impressive phone as well at the end of the year.Update 06-06-2019Due to the great uncertainty of the future of this phone I returned it to EE.After great consideration and research I've switched to the Sony Xperia 1. This is quite different but I'm growing very fond of it every day a bit more.Initial tests on camera are very promising. Video is the most important feature on a primary smartphone. I'm impressed so far with the Sony.Being a Japanese company there shouldn't be any trade wars!",1

5,"This phone (Huawei P20 Lite) is the best device I have ever owned! Macro photographs of insects and flowers come out absolutely stunning. The screen is better than any Huawei before it (Mate 8 for example), more vibrant. Low light photographs are better than say iPhone 6 and much better than Nokia 8. The only big downside is that opening the Camera app and snapping a picture is slow sometimes.  The device is very light and thin, but the standby battery life is amazing. Even with fairly heavy use during the day, I can get by without a charger until next morning if I just close the screen before bed. It does not come with a quick charger, but it still charges quite quickly with the enclosed charger.I also have to mention the excellent cell reception. I had a Sony Xperia XA briefly before this phone, and it could not at all compete with this phone. Overall the price to performance ratio is great! However, before howling out how great this phone is I have to mention that it is fairly fragile. Because it is so thin, it can bend in your pocket, if you're not careful.I got my device with an insurance, and that saved me! It should only cost about 9 GBP a month and 30 GBP if you break it, and you get a new phone. Highly recommended!",1
5,"After being a huge fan of Apple, I really didn't want to admit at any point that any android phone could be in any way decent. After having had Apple devices after years of disappointment with Android phone's, I couldn't see how even a flagship Android could compare, never mind exceed expectations. So when I upgraded my phone from iPhone XR to the P30 Pro, I really wanted to dislike it! Honestly, after a few days of ownership, I've struggled to dislike it at all.Okay, so the packaging is reminiscent of Apple packaging, the clean white box, the manufacturers branding etc.. In the box, you have the phone, earphones, rapid charger and warranty info.The P30 Pro feels like a very sturdy phone, the beautifully coloured metal back feels like a touch of luxury! The curved screen can be a bit of a game changer if you're not used to a curved screen (the prospect was new to me), after a few hours of playing around with it, I soon found that I got used to it and the appeal of it was seen at that point. Out of the box the phone had 50% battery power and with the rapid charger, I was ready to use it in 30 minutes!! It can be charged by the mains charger (very quickly, I might add), wirelessly via a wireless charger, or by another phone when positioned back to back, did I mention that you can also charge it that way!?  Pretty handy for if you happen to get stuck. Huawei also offer a car charger which is supposed to be a quick option too for when you are out and about, though I haven't used it or got around to buying that yet. I would say that getting a case for your new phone is a Must, because the beck, though rather luxurious, is extremely slippy and will slide off your lap /out of your hand/on surfaces, a little too easily. For cases Hauwei have their own reasonably priced cases here on Amazon, I've opted for the clear case because anything else would be a waste of the colour of this phone. I would like to add that I'm not being paid or supplemented for this review, I'm just an excited, new, Hauwei customer!I seen that someone in the reviews commented that it isn't a duel sim phone, if you happen to have the 128gb vog-l29, you have duel sim capability! On the sim card tray, you have 'Sim1' that is for your primary sim. Then on the other side, it states something like 'NM1' or similar, I can't remember exactly what it says but it's similar to what I've stated, this is actually a duel function side (the NM side), because it will either hold a second sim or it will hold a nano memory card. If you opt for the sim, you will only be able to use data from one sim at a time, and just like with Apple, you will have to select a primary sim in the settings, but this does not limit you to the use of just the one sim. You can rename the sims in your settings to ease any confusion and you can choose which sim you want to use for each call you make and text you send. There are apparently some nifty apps out there that will help you separate contacts if you have the sims for separate things such as work and social functions.The 8GB ram makes for smooth running as you download apps, play music and surf the Web. I will admit that because I didn't want to like the P30 Pro, I did test it a bit to see if it would falter, I did this by downloading loads of apps while playing music and opening as many apps as possible and going between them all, also downloading music and larger files. I'm amazed to say that there was no force closing of apps, no lag and everything was incredibly smooth running-wise. Hauwei - 1 me - 0, again!!The screen is far better than the XR, clearer, more depth, more colour and definitely more pleasant to look at! I can't believe I've just wrote that, but it is true!The camera blew me away, it captures moments with absolute clarity! The auto focus is awesome, and not to mention, your focal point can be literally anything, a person, an animal, scenery - anything, the camera will recognise that you want to focus on whatever it is and will cleverly blur the background and really bring forward your focal point. My XR only managed this with people!The sound is awesome too! So clear and of course it would have to be, it's Dolby Atmos. It's not tinny at all, I've listened to so many music tracks on my P30 Pro and nothing is a challenge and the battery holds out well to this too!I could go on forever, but I'll save you from my excited rants and round this up by saying that if you are thinking of going for this phone, what are you waiting for?!! Honestly, even if you think Apple is good, try this!! It is more than fantastic.",1

3,"I received this product as part of a review programme in return for an unbiased review.Before I first received this mobile I didn't have any preconceptions about it.  I'd heard of the Huawei brand, but that was about it.What first caught my eye when I open the box was the screen layout, and it's almost borderless design.  Aesthetically it's quite pleasing and the weight is good.  However, I was somewhat worried about dropping it as I thought it would break quite easily!As you can probably imagine, setting up the phone was easy. Most devices now are pro-active and seem to anticipate what the user needs.Adding my email accounts was key, so I set about doing this.  The Live (aka Hotmail) simple enough, the AOL not so.  Making connection to this kept failing, so I added the security option.  BIngo!  All done.Much has been said about the mobiles' camera so I decided to test it out.  When at my local park, I took a few shots, which was relatively easy.  What I couldn't find was a macro mode, which I have on my current mobile.  Otherwise the results were good.  No better or worse that I'd seen before.I then tried the video mode, shooting from light to dark, then back.  I liked the options that were given, including the professional mode.  What I got was impressive.  Far removed from the old days of really low pixel efforts in poor light.Being a relatively recent convert to Android, from iOS, I'm a big fan of the platform and it's versatility.  This mobile uses it well, although no more or less than other brands/models.  I thought the transition between apps a little fiddly, but maybe I'm used to how my previous mobiles work.One thing that did bug me during the testing was the location of the home/power on button and the volume.  It was easy to press the wrong one by mistake.I'd seen but never used the fingerprint scanner that is present on this mobile.  Can be useful if you are rubbish at remembering your password, or pattern, which is easily done in this tech age.  Answering calls is easier this way, too.Overall it's a good mobile.  Although I tested the Lite version, there's still enough to keep the user happy.  The price is a little steep, although I guess it would be considered mid range.It's biggest marketing point is the camera, I guess, so you need to consider what you are buying it for:making calls, texting and social networking, or taking high-end photos?  Nonetheless, this is lighter than carrying a digital SLR.",0

5,"I was really shocked at the review ratings of the phone until i realised its all related to the typo error of amazon stating it was a dual sim handset. Amazon were really good with providing me with a solution for not recieving a dual sim handset, and i can imagine an employee somewhere has got a slap on the wrist for the error.however the phone itself is phenomenal, and the update to the phone has erradicated all the bugs and glitches someone mentions. i did find that the update did not get pushed over the air, and i did need to download the huawei sync software onto my pc and update my phone that way. i did this within a few days of recieving the phone. since updating the phone has been faultless and i do not miss my samsung galaxy at all.It is a super fast smartphone, with smooth interface. the menus and themes are all customisable and theres something for everyones taste, although i imagine the fact that it cant be rooted will be an issue to some. i however have no interest in doing so.  the camera features are out of this world compared to other flagships, and the AI built into this phone really boosts what it is capable of.i like the notch compared with the s10+, and find i dont notice it at all sometimes ans its very small and central. the screen is good too, and really adapts well to save battery life. speaking if which, the battery is my most favourite part of this phone, as it easily lasts me 2 full days. i like the size of the phone as i can grip it well, although the screen is tall. the breathing crystal version of the handset is a talking point with anyone who sees it, but i do dislike that the camera sticksout quite a bit.all unboxing videos before release showed a preinstalled screen protector and clear back case included, so i was pretty dissapointed that the Uk releases didnt have them included. but i did have my trusted spigen hybrid crystal case ready before I even recieved the phone. ive bought a 3.5 to usb c adapter to use my existing earphones, although it would've been nice to have them included in the box, although a usb c earphone was included.  people need to stop complaining about the headphone jack not included, as going forward all future flagship phones will no longer carry them.i highly recommended buying the huawei p30 pro and cannot think of any reason why someone who wants to buy a flagship should hold back when compared with other competion. the only negative i must mention is that if you want to expand the 128gb memory you need to buy a different format of memory card called nm card by huawei, and it is very expensively priced compared to micro sd cards. most people may be more than satisfied with the already large internal storage though. also ive been having trouble finding a decent glass screen protector for the curved screen thats case friendly too. i must've gone through 8 different ones already and still searching. although i can imagine that being the issue with all curved screen phones.",1

5,What a great phone!,0
4,"I love the cameras on the phone. All three rear cameras are great and the night mode is amazing. If you are buying for the cameras you won't be disappointed.Regarding the phone, the fingerprint reader is poor at times and can fail to read my print on the first attempt. Sometimes I have to resort to a passcode. Huawei place their own EMUI skin over Android and it's weak in places. Not a deal breaker, but disappointing at times. There are no icon badges on the phone, email and SMS apps to let you know the number of new actions. Also EMUI seems a little clunky compared to a Samsung or LG phone.Overall I am glad I bought the P30 pro as it's got style and a lovely finish. The cameras are amazing.",1
3,Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera,0
1,"I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.",1
2,I don't like,0
1,"My review is just not about the product alone but also about the pathetic service provided by Amazon.I have been using this phone for the past 5 days. I observe a lag when I browse through photos while using Google photos and also for some reason my YouTube videos are being set at low quality, by any means I am not able to change it. Camera quality does not seem to be good, too much of colour in the output and the pictures does not seem natural.Amazon service quality can be compared to bsnl or other semi govt entity. During the delivery processes itself, the delivery date was deferred 4 times and the customer care staff wasn't hesitant to provide delivery assurance on the same day for all calls I made regarding the concern.After 5 days of usage when I was not happy with the phone and wanted to return it for refund. I was explained of another painful process wherein I need to hard reset the 5 day old phone and go through the process of reinstalling all the apps and data back to the phone and then get it tested. If they find a fault with the phone, then it gets just replaced and not refunded. As a customer I again need to take a chance with the replaced phone. If the problems persists, then I am at their mercy to get a refund. Uffff, once you pay then you are indebted to listen to us, I believe this is Amazon policy.",1

1,Huawei is no premium phone. Read full to understand buggy software issues before you buy. Bought it 25 October 2018. Got on 28 October. It's June 2019* and battery got inflated. My back cover came out on its own. Worst part is Service center didn't give warranty. They charged me 1500 to replace battery citing battery is not under warranty.So no quality hardware or warranty given. And I didn't even use this phone much.Buying Huawei is the worst decision ever. Don't go by illusory specifications. You need solid software to run hardware.Camera Quality is worst than sub 9000 phones.Software is buggy. It won't allow dual applications except for whatsap Facebook. Joke when you compare to XiaomiEverytime you connect to Wi-Fi or switch on mobile data Huwaei sends some unknown information to its servers. You can check it by connecting to Wi-Fi having no internet. It will ask you to login and subsequently try to send information to Huwaei server under guise of connectivitycheck url. It's not Google server but Huwaei 😂😉🤔 why do they need to do that? Spying?It doesn't connect to Wi-Fi automatically even to known networks.OS is buggy and lacks features when you compare to MIUI aka Xiaomi Phones.Applications don't update as Huwaei has issues with Google play security.Not A smooth experience at allThis is after over six months of issue.Performance wise even a sub 9000 phone can beat this phone hands down.All in all an underperforming substandard buggy  product at premium price with spying built inUSA is not incorrect to blame Huwaei of duping and spying.With Google going to stop support to Huwaei phones because of Ban on Huwaei please avoid this phone at all costs.Don't be fooled by advertising.Good luck,1
2,"Writing this review after more than six months of vigorous usage and here is some briefing on the issues I’ve faced:CAMERA: When using HONOR 8X camera in indoor low lighting conditions it remind me of some of my older VGA camera phones used 6-7 years ago. It delivers exactly same output. This 20, 16, megapixels these are just some jugglery of numbers to misguide consumers actually a 8 MP I Phone can shoot 20 times better picture than this HONOR 20MP mobiles. Unstable focusing . As reviewed by many others in outdoor lighting HONOR cameras captures artificial colours and believe me it is ABSOLUTELY True.CONNECTIVITY: Bluetooth band and Wi-Fi band never works together. I’ve tested this failure several times and if internet is connected via wi-fi, Bluetooth audio transmission starts buffering. After finding no solution to this (even speaking to customer service) now a day I’m compelled to use mobile data to stream videos/music while using Bluetooth headset/speakers.SOFTWARE ISSUES: Automatically some number gets redialed from the call list when one call finishes. After the latest EMUI 9 update many phone functions getting worse. Sound output is super low, Face Recognition function is farce and so on…Waiting to throw out this crap at the earliest.",1
3,"Using this phone from last 5days.Phone display size, look, processor,  touch is good.Camara is too bad. They gave 20, 2mp rear but not upto the mark. Front also 16mp but picture quality is not as per expectation.Diply and Colours are not good compared with other phones in this midrange.Performance and Gaming is nice. But for few game details are going into notch & curved portion. I checked other honor mobiles also this devices need software updates very soon. Other wise it would impact the brand value.I don't have idea which lens they used for Camara and surely this will impact company brand value in future.Battery life - 3* and phone have heating problem.Overall, good phone bt not the best in this range.I got this on bank offer @13500INR. In this range may get Samsung J6, j6plus. Redmile note 5 pro camara is too good compared with this phone.  4gb ram +64gb ram mid range phone we may get below 12k. The thing I expected from honor is camara, battery and performance . But only performance is is good . Camara and battery are not upto the mark.

1,"I'll keep this review short and simple.I read all the reviews related with this product and was very impressed with the specifications. Thus, I ordered this product on Amazon as there was a deal for this product and I got it in 14k. All things were good with this device however the battery performance was very poor.In the reviews, it was mentioned that it gets charged upto 100% within 2-3 hours of charge. Mine was taking 7-8 hours to get fully charged. Also the battery was draining very fast, like within 2-3 hours of using the internet, gaming and videos, it was getting completely discharged.I waited for the updates on it to see if this problem gets fixed but nothing happened. I thought it might be only with this unit, so I decided to return it for a replacement.But again I faced the same issue along with heating one added on it. It was heating too much that even I could have ironed my shirt. So again I returned that and once again though of play one last gamble here with this product.But again it let me down. Battery and heating issues were still there. At last, fed up with this device and returned it for a full refund.Luckily, at that time, HONOR Play was in sale with the same price of 14 k and I ordered that one. Honestly, it's the best device in this range and nothing can beat it in this price ever. fully packed performance in every manner.So if you want to go for a fully packed device with 5 star in all specifications, go for Honor play, instead of 8x.Thanks!",1
1,"Camera quality is worst.  Redmi phones 5 mp camera is 100 times better than this. Audio volume is not good (music). Not worth spending so much money on this. I was using MI MAX 6.440'' screen. HONOR 8X width is lesser than MI MAX of 6.44.''.  Please don't buy. Go for REDMI OR MI phones. U can't create dual apps for all. REDMI, MI phones have many features which this 8x doesn't have. If u want to waste your money buy this. I  writhin this after using it for 15 days. Battery back up is average.... Cheap quality camera....That's why they had given 2000Rs discount it seems.

Sound quality again not something I can proudly talk about, it's just okay. There are many other features which I am yet to venture. When I do, I will update.",1
2,"Picture quality is awful. I can't understand how different techies on you tube provided such a good feedback. The camera is hell, selfie loving guys is gonna hate it. Primary camera only good if held still. YouTube videos I compared to my 1plus 3t and I can see a huge difference in the quality and color. Battery backup is good , design is unmatchable at this price range ,display size is good but the display quality is cheap. I would recommend not buying this phone and rather go for note 5 pro which has better camera and better display and comes about 2500 cheaper than this phone. If looks and design is all you are looking for ..then honor 8x is the best phone for u",1
3,This was my first shopping in amazon and if I am not wrong then the last also. I don't know what they think people buying a product worth 15k and the packaging is just simple polymer bag . This is really annoying. Now coming to the products pros and con'sPros.1. Build quality and look is really awesome2. Display is also very good3. Battery life is much better than realme 2 pro4. Rear camera is goodCon.1. Front facing camera is really pathetic this is not a 16mp camera . Picture quality is like 5 mega pixel camera2. No display protection,1

1,"1st thing who like gaming avoid honor GPU turbo is just a talk but in reality in nothing. 1st 2 months OK after that now there are lags and frame drops in every game Asphalt 8, 9 and even small games like angry birds are lagging2. They release software updates too slow in small batches3. After sale service is tooooo poor.4. Pie update has lot of bugs5. AI Camera 🤔🤔it's a big joke even my old redmi note 3 5 mp camera after miui 10 update produce better edge detection for portraits compared to 16 mp camera6. They release 2 models in india one is made in China and made in India models they treat both customers in different ways regarding updates EX: made in India models only get android pie beta update",1
2,"I am re writing my update after 3 months of using it. Recently in the last week of March, Honor 8x got Android Pie update which was very unsatisfactory due to the following reasons.1. Firstly, the battery performance worsened after android pie update. Before the update, a single full charge would give you more than 1 day of standby time, 2days standby in power saving mode and 5days in ultra power saving mode. Now with Honor's pie update, this has been reduced to 19 hours with 1 day in power saving mode. So I recommend all new buyers not to update your phone's operating system to pie. Be happy with Oreo as it is more efficient.2. Lots of bugs with the latest pie update. Launching time increases for some apps.3. Camera performance has degraded after Android pie update. Now the pictures appear very dull and washed out. Also, the back ground blurring in portrait mode is worsened and looks very artificial, when compared to the previous Oreo.Otherwise Honor 8x is a good phone as long as you are happy with Android Oreo.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ALL CUSTOMERS NOT TO UPDATE YOUR PHONE'S OS TO ANDROID PIE IF YOU ARE BUYING IT.Even as I was typing this review, battery percentage decreased from 48% to 44% which is very very bad and disheartening.",1
2,1. The most important feature of direct video calling is not available in this honor phone.Video calling possible only through third party app. This is main and pathetic failure of this phone.2. Saturation of pictures are very high.3. Video quality & picture quality is not upto mark as compare to same range of phones.,0
3,I am using this from 6days here many cons compere with realme 2 proPros1)battery2)proceccer3)build quality remaining specifications are better in realme 2proCons1)camara  ;Average  performance2)display ;poor display3)gaming experience ;not handling smooth4)sound quality is very poor  I think realme 2pro is better than honor8x,1

1,Just 20 days back I bought this Honor 8X through Amazon only. Now sudden on 13 Feb my phone got bent due to any manufacturing defect now honor team is not even giving me warranty against that. Please don't buy such a bakwas mobile phone. Better to stay with Samsung & Nokia instead of some chinese phone.,1

3,"Decent Performance so far. I've been using 8x for a couple of months now. Good battery backup. Lasts 1 complete day (not a heavy gamer). No network issue. No heating. Reliable!The reason for 3 stars is as follows...my device has this display problem, all the SIDES of the display are blurred (dark edges), including notch area!Upon seeing images which are dark or when a pop up appears, you can spot this issue! Disappointed!",0
1,"Honest review after usage of 3days.Previous mobile :redmi note 5proBought honor 8x because water went inside of note5pro. First let me clarify one thing, this honor 8x 6gb varient nowhere near to 4GB note 5pro. Either camera or performance. Trust me front camera is very bad. You wont see your face if you use selfie in this mobile. Back camera is just average. Coming to the performance, kirin processor wont handle much tasks. Please consider snapdragon if you want a good mobile. I played pubg in balanced low mode. Still its hanging. There is a drop in frame rate. I played balanced medium mode in note5pro. Very smooth in that mobile. I tried many settings in honor 8x but nothing worked. Pathetic mobile.Ui: updated after one day, its running on android pie. I dont know is this a bug or glitch, if any message or mail comes, you have to open to everything like who sent what is the text. Funny honor. In this new era we have to open app to reply or see the content. App lock is slow. Some glitches in ui which may be fixed in coming updates. Not to forget heating issue. Play 20 minutes, heating will start. Battery is ok. You can manage one day with moderate usage. Bought this in a hurry, now regretting. Could have bought real me or redmi. Please dont trust who says this mobile is excellent. I bought almost 6 mobiles. This mobile makes me sad. Gone 17k. But it is a experience, in future i wont buy honor. Thank you honor for your excellent mobiles.",0

3,Product is good at this budget.Sexy look and field with a big screen. Not at all a gaming mobile. Mobile is getting heated while playing games and watching 4k or 1080 HD video.

5,It is a very good phone I was little bit confused which to buy wait for asus zenfone max pro m2 or honor 8x. But when i saw detailed reviews of honor 8x i immediately purchased this mobile.Their r few reasons to buy honor 8x for me1. 12nm processor (2.2Ghz)2. Battery efficiency (AI)3. Glass body and unique design with metal frames.4. Chin is very small compaired to other 📱 in this range(because of on chip display technology)5. Camera is very good both(front and back).(AI camera)6. Gaming is awesome (PUBG supports GPU Tarbo) mindblowing graphics.And also thanks to amazon.1. Good delivery 🚚2. Secure package.Thank u honor and thank u amazon team.Friends go for it without any doubts. Far better than Asus Max Pro M2.,1
5,"After using the phone after four days I am writing this review.  Phone looks pretty awesome, you don't feel that you purchased in the price range of 15K and you will feel premium in hand. No headphones on the box might disappoint you a little. Camera effect is decent, one thing I am not satisfied with is the noise in the image, its yuk . You can feel the effect on image, but you will not be satisfied on it due to the noise in it , while zooming can be seen clearly. Next the screensize, though size is much bigger, you won't need second hand to support it . Its much handy . Screenguard and cases are given already in the box,thats a good bonus and you can start using it immediately. though the pixels range are higher , due to the bigger screen size you may not satisfied with the clarity it gives on the video or whatever on the screen. Screen could have better. But its not logically possible to give everything for this range, so its an acceptable clarity on this range phones. Next battery,  I never felt any phone holding the battery much longer time even after heavy use. It will come more than a day . Phone is not hanging even after loading multiple apps. Played Pubg, works very faster than my galaxy s8. Speed you can even compare it any high end phones,Such an incredible speed you get for 15K under. So everything are given more than the price range. Go for it guys.. you will fallen in love with this beauty all day.",1
5,"After using one month feeling good.1 BUILD QUALITY -compared to other mobiles in this price range this is the best choice as you got sensational metal with glass back side which makes this perfect.2 PICTURE QUALITY-clicks a little saturated Sharp images in terms of day light the camera detail is very clear ,if you want natural image you may select PRO mode otherwise colour will be saturated and warm ,in low light it also clicks good detail.3 BATTERY LIFE - good phone for heavy users, 1 day avarage feedback with games playing Camera and video recording and phone calls but 1.5 day up to mark.4 SOUND QUALITY- Decent music speaker, in music player the playback option is very convenient with 3D sound effect and headphone options,volume is louder in phone mic speaker , the secondary noise cancellation makes it clear.5 PERFORMANCE- The Kirin 710 chipset gives very good speed for game and app loading, first choice for PUBG lovers.All over this is the best choice if u have 12k budget",1
5,"As on the date, November 18, this was the best phone after applying all the offers and keeping the budget range in limit... After narrowing down 2 smartphone giants, xiaomi mi A2 and Honor 8x, I went for Honor 8x as i was ready to compromise a liiiiiiitle bit of picture clarity, coz it was a software issue and not hardware, whereas as the cons of Mi were all hardware related like the smalllest battery in range... Who wants an all time dying battery.... Moreover, the screen of 8X...nothing to say abt it... It looks amazing... Just flaunting it now... So yea... This was the review by far.",1
4,it’s actually a good product for the price of 15000₹ !they’re many pros when compared to cons of the mobiledisplay quality ✅camera not so good ❌performance wise great 👍🏻gaming experience was pretty good 😊battery okay not that great 😕speed of the phone is awesome 😎but still not totally satisfied but kinda okay 🙃i like the color & shiny mirror finishing on backside of mobile though 💫  !if you wanna buy something good you can go for it at this price but still you can go for something better !but again this phone is worth for this price 🤷🏻‍♂️,1
5,"Excellent device for this budget, can easily compete with the mi a2 in terms of ram management. There's a setting which allows you to customize your ram management. After that the ram management is even better than the so speculated  mi a2.  Battery backup is excellent, can stand a whole day with a single charge. Charges quickly too, took me 30 mins roughly to take it from 50-100%. The hisilicon kirin 710 is even better than the sd 660, so stop comparing with the benchmarkscores. The camera is also quite good, although the mi a2 has an advantage in this segment. The sound quality is okay-ish, not that great, but at the price point it's totally negotiable. If you're someone much into launcher apps, then emui is definitely the ui skin for you. The ample choices of themes on the play store make it a pleasant experience to use the emui. The backshooter 20mp+2mp combo could have been improved, and there are a bit problems with the camera performance, but hopefully they'll be fixed in the next software update. On security backgrounds, the fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest I've ever used, in this budget range, also the face scanning is slightly a bit buggy as it tends to unlock even when you're not looking at it. Face if works in lowlight conditions too, but not in pitch darkness. Overall I'd say this is THE smartphone to go for in this budget range.",1
5,"So, I bought this little beast, Honor 8x, 6GB/64GB variant, whose MRP was 16,999 but thanks to the Great Amazon Exchange offer, I got a discount of 4200 on exchange of my 4 year old lenovo k4 note phone, and exchange was conviniently successful without and hassle. So my effective price was around 13,000, so kudos to Amazon for that <3.Now let's get technical which most of you are here for..After a few days of use, here is a list of all PROs and CONs of Honor 8x that I experienced.Pros :- Premium Glass Body <5/5>, You will feel like you are holding something very elegant (I have the blue tint back)- comes with a back cover and screen guard pre applied, you won't have to buy any additional items- EMUI 8.2 <5/5>, now this is a personal opinion, though I am using it for the first time, if you would compare it to MiUI, EMUI feels more closer to stock Android. Also there is an update of about 850MB for the latest version of EMUI. Huge option of customization and features.Camera quality <4/5> is very good, but not excellent. Colour saturation is a bit high, Though there are lots of features and edit options in the camera itself, you might be expecting a better camera if you are paying 17k for the phone.- Lot of helpful apps by Honor pre installed that actually helps you set up your phone quickly from backups of old phone. You don't have to download 3rd party apps from playstore. It also has inbuilt Screen Recorder in notification area.- lots of features like, hiding notch, split screen, dual 4g, 2 SIM+MicroSD, custom display resolution (low/high)- Gaming <5/5> This is a beast, and can run most games on high settings with smooth frames, however it gets slightly warm (but not hot) if you play intense gaming for hours, which is quite normal.Note that there is an option of Screen Resolution in Display setting, which can be chosen between HD+ (1560 x 720){low} and FHD+ (2340 x 1080){high}, which will define how your Games will be running, for ex, if you chose low 720p reso, your game will run smoother and will give less load to your phone, if you chose 1080p then your game might frame and your performance might drop, So there is a Smart Resolution feature which automatically sets resolution for the best performance and battery optimization. However you can manually select them too.Battery optimization <5/5> is done very well, you can probably do 5-7 hours of continuous gaming. It also comes with an option of Power Saving mode which gives you a lifetime of 2 days 12 hrs and Ultra Power Saving mode which gives 8 days 12 hrs, as shown in Battery management. Charging is decent.Ram management is OK, where the default system consumption (if you limit background apps) is about 2.4GB out of 6GB, giving you a free RAM availability of 3.6GB to be usable, enough to run lots of apps simultaneously or together in split screen, butter smoothly.All in all this is a mini beast at affordable range.Let's discuss CONs :-The entire phone is ""Glassy"", the back, even the buttons, so it is very prone to get smudges, scratches, and cracks if dropped, so I would suggest to apply back cover immediately.- Not all apps are designed for notch layouts, so you might see a few oddly looking apps. There is an option to force view an app on full display.-Camera could have been a little better.That's all, and with all these factors in mind I think this is a great phone to buy.If you found my review helpful, do rate it up.THANK YOU.",1
5,"As it's Name says 'Xtraordinary'. It is built to be the best in it's price range. Camera issues can be fixed but everything else is designed to last long. The EMUI is wonderful with so many customizations options. No lags. Honor has done a very good job in making the design of phone look premium and with its 6.5"" screen size giving way to 91% screen to body ratio.The processor Kirin 710 is a very powerful in its price segment. No heating issues. Battery is powerful enough to use. Honor hasn't compromised upon any thing. They have given the best possible phone in this price range.A must purchase phone!! Hat's off to Honor!!!!!",1
5,"First of all, this honor 8X is fresh with new Kirin 710 processor which is fast enough to compete with sd 660. Specially honor has really worked on its emotion UI and the performance is way better than old honor phones.This is also loaded with unique features, gestures, options and also settings to customize the phone.Overall  one of the best mid ranger with solid build quality.The camera  is not the best in the segment and also 4K video missing in this phone. Features like EIS could have been provided bu the company. Hope honor improve some features and include new ones with OTA updates.",1
5,"It's too good for 15K...I have used iPhone, Samsung, HTC higher end models.. But 8x has the value for money factor and useful for all our day today activities..Camera quality is also good...",0
4,"I have been using this phone since 25th Oct, and honestly i have mixed feelings about the device(mostly good), so i am going to divide my review in Pros and Cons and will let you decide if you can live with the cons or not.Pros:1. Phone just feels great: when you open the phone from box, it feels so premium and stylish, you will fall in love with it then and there.2. High quality Screen: the screen looks really nice and the quality is 10/10. you will get premium phones high quality Screen experience, honor has make sure of that.3. Battery: I was very Impressed with the battery performance, if you are a regular user who use the phone for usual stuff like calls, social networking and moderate gaming or video watching, then the battery can even last more than 24hrs easily.and even for moderate to advanced users, the Battery is not something to worry about for full working day.4. UI - User interface is user friendly and has something for everyone, certainly much better than my last phone - Xiaomi MI Max.5. Bigger display - whooping 6.5 inch display is simply a treat to watch, even the notch management is top notch(pun intended :-D), specially if you like to watch video in phone, then certainly this phone can give really good viewing experience.6. screen cover and backcase: kudos to Honor for their Backcase and screen guard with the box, the quality of both are good and certainly you don't need to buy these separately(if you don't have anything specific in your mind).7. Ram Management: Ram management is good with phone and you won't face any issues with Ram related performance, hence you can be assured for good gaming experience specially on moderate settings.Cons:1. Phone Hanging Issue: this was really a shocker, i never imagined that i ll face frozen screen issue within first week of phone, i have faced frozen screen issue multiple times and its really frustrating, hopefully someone from Honor check this and rectify this with software updates.2. Camera Quality: well, i am a little disappointed with camera quality specially when it has 20(back) and 16(front) Megapixel shooters. its not bad but more like hit or miss, the quality is not consistent, i am guessing honor can take this up and fix it with software updates. i ll try to put some samples pics  later sometime.3. long charging time: more than 2 to 2.5 hrs is certainly not a feel good factor for me.4. Speaker volume: what to say, it is low. Although doesn't matter much to me as i hardly use speaker for calls except Whatsapp or other video calls.5. audio playback of media even when phone is kept on silent: This is something which troubled me in office, even when my phone is in silent/vibration mode, while playing video on social media sites, the Audio playback is not silenced. this can put you in awkward situation sometimes(personal experience :P) , although i really hope Honor fix this with updates.My overall conclusion: Overall i really loved the phone and most of the issues i have seen and witnessed, can be fixed with software updates, hopefully Honor realize the same and work on it to fix the issues.having said that Phone is definitely packed with brownie points, specially crisp and bigger display, long lasting battery and premium feel of the phone, these features really makes it a great product at this price range.",1
5,"The smartphone market is in a strange place right now. Flagships are getting more expensive yet aren't adding much more that consumers or businesses actually want in the way of features. Meanwhile the mid range is filling with phones that have pretty much all the features you will actually use on a day-to-day basis at good prices. It's not clear how this is going to play out, but right now the level of choice for buyers is great.Bought it in Diwali sale and gifted to my brother along with Huawei P20. Its a eye candy phone looks are stunning and it's the best looking phone in this segment.Battery life is solid one day despite of the screen size, and camera quality is better than its competitors. Honor is the next big thing in the cellphone market.Thanks you for your time, its a great day.",1
5,"Everything about this phone is good. The camera could have been a lil better and I think this will get fine with a software update.I've been using iPhone 6s and I felt honor is better in terms of user experience. It is difficult for me to get out of the Apple ecosystem as I have a mac Pro, 3 ipads, an apple watch, 2 iPhones but I must tell you that making honor my primary phone is a good choice I made. I did not see any wisdom in buying the other flagships from Samsung or any other company, to me it's just showoff or satisfying the ego. I may be wrong here but my usage doesn't demand me to have a flagship and moreover, the specs are also the same.Huawei has really come a long way and I feel it's here to stay.Android has taken a huge leap and is far ahead of ios in terms of user interface and usability. I realised how outdated I was, using iPhone, compared to the latest Android. I also had a blackberry keyone as my standby phone and that has taken the third seat.And yes I got an honor 9n for my employee and was surprised to see seamless connectivity between honor phones.",1

5,"After 7+ days of use..My first honor phn was 6x, 7x and now this one, 8x (wow)Amazing premium look and build quality which has now become hallmark of Honor devices. But the biggest problem this time is glass back, it really really slippery cant imagine using it without back case.. Also it attracts smudges, dirt and fingerprint like a magnet..But it is a big upgrade from 7x considering the design, camera, display, battery(superb) and specially the way 8x uses the motion sensor, proximity sensor.. (pick up the ringing phn, volume will be lowered, place the near the ear while on the contact screen it will automatically make a call or answer the incoming call automatically, place the phn in front of your face it will automatically unlock and much more...)Sturdy performance Kirin 710 I think is much better than Sd 660 in all around performance..Call clarity, call volume, signal quality excellent..What a microphone, it detects ""Ok Google"" 5 meters distance from my home television(ads) with such a low volume (lol..)Dual 4g dual volte..Speaker loud enough..Earphone volume is little lowcompared to 7x with my Sony headset, quality is better though, now there is plenty of settings inside music player..Fingerprint sensor is lightning fast and amazingly accurate even with lightestpossible touch..Face unlock doesn't have infrared camera to detect in thedark night but it works somehow by increasing the back light of the displayand it is pretty accurate when there is a bright background or wallpaperbut struggles with dark background otherwise face unlock is very fast andaccurate too..Battery is a big bump what i noticed it lasts around 2 days with light use and around 15 to 18 hrs on heavy use (4 hrs of youtube, half hour gaming, 2 hr calling, etc) also i found around 9 hrs of screen on time.. Impressive!!Charging time is another surprising element fr me, 7x took around 150 minutes whereas it takes 100 to 110 mins only..Camera does not have any stabilisation, EIS or OIS(which isneither given in Nova 3) also it does not have 4K video recording.. Low light or artificial light photography is neither good nor bad..I like the camera hardware very much, it is way better than its predecessor but 7x used to over expose the images now 8x make it little over saturated.. Wish we will receive updates for camera software from Honor to make it the best camera phn among the competitors(Realme, Mi).. Camera is the segment where they have to pay utmost attention.. I would rate 7/10 to the camera..Everything else is top class..Overall its is an awesome phn around 15k, great VFM and 10% discount + 1000 cashback (effectively Rs.12500/-) is definitely is a loot..Thanks for your patience..",1
5,"READ THIS BEFORE BUYINGEverything in this phone is pretty except for some features but we can manage that, now the main problem is its display tech. guys. It is the cheapest display tech. which is used in this phone (tft display) . The main thing about phone is display. Due to the display everything you see whether it is a video or you play a ge, they are of entirely different colours. Ofcourse if you compare with other phone you will see.

So, here we go with the real review:1. Amazing display, details are good and crystal clear2. New unique UI feel (EMUI 8.2)3. One word for design, beauty. Slim n sexy (black i took) with glassback.4. AI camera is too good, auto adjust the color and focus along with depth sensers even in low light.5. Battery is undoubtedly long lasting, thanks to huawei for 3500+ mah battery 😃6. Sound is better, not the best honestly but not low as well, i can say I compared with iPhone 7 and easily did beat it.7. Better Ram management, fast processing by Kirin 710 huawei processor and GPU turbo for gaming.8. Type C fast charging is missing but that's not a big deal coz you need to carry type C cable always! Very less people use Type C.9. 4K VIDEO recording and OIS are missed but that's for motion videos, else totally fine.10. Under 15k,it's giving you more than what it could have given! Especially with huawei mfd. Brand name, its a prefect phone.Don't get confuse, go and buy!",1
5,Best device under this price range.... If you want to buy a phone under 15k you must go for this... I bought it after researching alot.... It is better than redmi note5pro and Nokia 6.1... Actually only Nokia can stand with this one redmi and realme 2 pro both are very inferior... Best thing I like about the phone is 1.design2.battery3.speed4.camera5.features of EMUI  CONSYou will not believe that this is the best phone 😅,1
5,"HIGHLIGHTSThe Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMsIt comes with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storagePerformance and display are great, but the cameras could have been betterHonor, Huawei's ambitious smartphone sub-brand, has had an aggressive strategy for India in the past few months, going all out by releasing multiple models priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 in quick succession. The new Honor 8X is aimed at the competitive Rs. 15,000 price segment, where the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) has been quite popular for quite some time.But that's not the only smartphone that the Honor 8X is up against. There are other great options such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power (Review), and the Realme 2 Pro (Review). So, does Honor's latest launch deliver enough performance and featuers to take on the might of these heavy hitters, all of which have received positive reviews from us? We put the Honor 8X to the test.Honor 8X designOne of the marquee features of the Honor 8X is its design, something that differentiates it from the others in its price segment. It boasts of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, especially for a phone that starts at just Rs. 14,999. Honor calls this a “visual grating effect” and says it has used multiple layers of glass to achieve it.However, the glossy back on the Honor 8X is extremely prone to smudges and even scratches. Putting a case on this phone — fortunately a soft TPU one is bundled in the box — is the only way to safeguard the beautiful design.Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin compared to previously launched Honor phones such as the Honor Play and Honor 9N. There is a 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around.Ditching the Honor logo on the front is another change that we welcomed. The phone sports a 6.5-inch display, but has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone 8 Plus. It is definitely not made for comfortable one-handed usage, and we ended up using both hands for most functions. Still, this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm.The Honor 8X is available in three colour options in India — a classic black, a trademark blue, and a bold red. We tried out the blue option which was a looker. It reflects light when you turn it in your hand. The black option is for users who like to keep it sober, while the red finish would be for those who really want to stand out.AdvertisementThe Honor 8X has a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor at the backThe Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities.AdvertisementThe power and volume buttons are located on the right of the device and are decently large. The left of the phone only houses the SIM tray. This tray can take two Nano SIM cards as well as a microSD card at the same time.Then, you get a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the loudspeaker, and the primary microphone on the bottom. A USB Type-C port would have been preferable, but Honor India says cost constraints led it to choose between a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, so it went with the latter. On top is the secondary microphone that helps in cancelling out external noise during calls.The build quality is decent, however, we noticed a couple of scratches on the glass back panel within a few hours of regular usage. Considering there is no reinforced glass for protection at the back, a case is definitely recommended.AdvertisementOne aspect of the Honor 8X that is not very pleasant is the size of the earpiece. In an attempt to make the notch as small as possible, Honor has compromised with a tiny earpiece that makes listening to calls frustrating. A slight shift of the phone against your ear can completely block sound during calls.Honor 8X specifications and softwareThe Honor 8X is the sub-brand's first smartphone in India with a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, though we first saw it in the Huawei Nova 3i (Review). It's refreshing to see a mid-range Honor phone powered by something other than the over-used Kirin 659. This 12nm processor has four Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. It takes on the likes of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 and Snapdragon 660, both of which are currently popular in this price rangeThe review unit we tested was the base variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs. 14,999. There are two other options — 6GB RAM/ 64GB storage (for Rs. 16,999), and 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage (for Rs. 18,999). The Honor 8X had no problems in handling moderate multitasking, and storage was enough for a few dozen apps and lots of photos. The Honor 8X supports additional storage of up to 400GB using a microSD card.The massive 6.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, which should be crisp and clear enough for most people. Honor touts that the display has a blue light filter called Eye Comfort Mode that been certified by TUV Rheinland, a technical advisory firm, making it easy on the eyes.Honor has gone with a 3,750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) charging. There is a dual camera setup at the back with a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera is placed in the notch at the front. The Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMs. You get an ambient light sensor, an electronic compass, a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, and a fingerprint sensor. Connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, FM radio, GPS/A-GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou.The unit we tested was running EMUI 8.2.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. An Android Pie update is coming to the Honor 8X, but the company has not announced any official timelines. The phone was running the September 2018 security patch when we got it, which is a good thing. There are quite a few customisations available with EMUI, and the amount of bloatware has reduced drastically, as we noted in our Honor Play review as well. You get just a few preloaded apps such as Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Camera360, and a freemium game called Lords Mobile.The icons look too large, and a more minimal approach would have been appreciated. There's a Phone Manager app that helps you free RAM, block certain apps, track mobile data usage, check for viruses, and keep a check on battery drain. For the power user, this app is a neat way to keep track of the phone's vitals.The Themes app adds a new Indian theme that we didn't like the look of at all. We preferred the default theme; and there are three others to choose from.Gestures on EMUI were our choice of navigation on the Honor 8X given its humongous display and lack of reachability. You can swipe up from the bottom centre to go back to the home screen, swipe up and hold to reveal the app switcher, or swipe up from the bottom left or bottom right to trigger Google Assistant. You can also swipe left or right in any app to go back to the previous screen.Honor's EMUI has its own dialler, calendar, gallery, music, video, and email apps. You can also mask the notch from within the Settings app.The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy, but isn't very secure compared to the 3D sensors that some high-end smartphones have. The Honor 8X was mostly accurate in recognising our registered faces, and was quick to unlock itself.Interestingly, it offered good results in low light and at night. The screen brightness automatically increases to help recognise faces. To compliment face recognition, the Honor 8X also has a snappy rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.Honor 8X performance, cameras, and battery lifeThe responsiveness and fluidity of Honor's EMUI has improved a lot over the past couple of years. The Honor 8X is a great example of that; it offered a largely lag-free experience and had no issues while multitasking with several apps at a time. The phone did, however, experience some stutter particularly while using Facebook Messenger. Switching between apps was smooth, but the Recent Apps gesture could do with some improvement in terms of fluidity.Call quality was top notch with the Honor 8X with decent reception even in areas with low cellular signals.As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimisation that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games.We tried heavy games such as Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG, but the latter ran well only at moderate settings. Lighter games such as Subway Surfers and Candy Crush were a breeze to use. Heating was minimal, and battery drain was reasonable during our scattered gaming sessions.In terms of benchmarks, the Honor 8X scored an impressive 140,435 in AnTuTu; 1,604 and 5,559 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests; and 7,176 in PCMark's Work 2.0 test. These are better scores than what we have seen from Snapdragon 636-powered phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, and even Snapdragon 660-powered devices such as the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and Realme 2 Pro. As for graphics benchmarks, the Honor 8X's GPU managed 35fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test and 13fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores are equal to or lower than what those same phones managed, showing that the Kirin 710's graphics performance isn't as strong as its general CPU performance.Honor's camera app has a straightforward interface. It highlights five major modes — Aperture, Night, Portrait, Photo, and Video. Other options like Pro, Slow-mo, Panorama, AR Lens, HDR, Time-lapse, and more are stashed under the “More” section. The app has an AI Photography option, much like other recent Honor phones, which can be turned off.Tap to see full-sized Honor 8X sample photosAn interesting addition is the ability to toggle AI mode even after a shot has been captured. This was actually helpful considering that some of the shots we took using AI mode came out overexposed with extreme contrast. The rear camera setup consists of a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, both with f/1.8 apertures. It supports slow-motion video recording at 480fps slowed up to 1/16th the normal speed.Given its price point, the Honor 8X's photo quality is nothing to write home about. Autofocus with the rear camera is quick and mostly accurate in good lighting, but the resulting photos lack clarity. Night shots look passable on the phone itself, but a lack of detail is clearly visible when seen at full size. The advertised AI camera mode is almost unusable in low light as it only ends up making shots look oversaturated by blowing out bright colours.The 16-megapixel selfie camera is much better in terms of sharpness in picture quality, and delivers good image definition in well-lit areas. Night shots are below average on the front camera too, and the screen flash does little to help.The Honor 8X supports up to 1080p video recording at 60fps, but has 720p set as the default. The lack of any form of stabilisation is evident considering how shaky videos turn out. Beautification works for both cameras but the results appear extremely artificial. The front camera gets a screen flash for low light selfies, which helps in the dark. .We were initially skeptical about how the battery life might turn out given the Honor 8X's massive 6.5-inch full-HD+ display. However, results were impressive, and the phone lasted the entire day on a single full charge. Our usage included browsing social media apps and checking emails all day, as well as streaming a couple of YouTube videos and a 15-minute gaming session, using both 4G and Wi-Fi networks.The Honor 8X also lasted 14 hours and 47 minutes in our proprietary HD video loop test. It charged up from 0 to 100 percent in slightly more than 2 hours with its bundled 10W charger.Honor 8X in picturesVerdictHonor is making an attempt to penetrate the market with a good-looking and relatively affordable phablet that offers good value for money. Not only does this phone look good, it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC. Other things that work for the Honor 8X include its looks, vibrant display, and fast biometric security features. However, the camera results are below average, the UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful.Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus' ZenFone Max Pro M1 have been in the market for around six months now, and are being challenged by newer options including the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Motorola One Power. The Honor 8X could also be a tempting choice for a lot of people.",1
4,"Well, This review is after 4 Days of Usage.**First of all, I would say my whole family is Honor bound since it's Launch. We've been using Honor 2, Honor Holly, Honor Bee, Honor 6x & now Honor 8x.** Why Honor phones throughout?  - Still our first phone Honor 2 is working and it's been nearly 6.5 years. So that should suffice I guess.**And Why Honor 8x and not any other phone in the market (Oppo F9 Pro / Vivo V11 / Realme 2 Pro / POCO etc.)  - 1. Trust & Brand of Huawei - Most of the above mentioned names are new entrants in the Telecom industry & Huawei has been there for nearly 4+ decades  - 2. Pricing for the 6GB Variant (My budget was always 15k-17k; Nowadays, Mobilephone market functions like a Use & Throw - The Sellers are keeping us occupied with added features in every launch - almost like every month - So always a budget performer with reliable quality gets a thumbs up from me)  - 3. Looks & Durability of Honor 8x when compared to the other models mentioned above.**How is the performance ?- UI - (5/5) EMUI is one of the best UIs available in the market next to the iPhones. I bet you no other phones has a better UI on offer other than Honor - Be it (ColorOS from OPPO / JOVI AI Asst. -Vivo / MIUI - of Xiaomi )  - CAMERA -  This is where I feel 8x is a bit let down. Yes! The Selfie cam is not at par with Oppo F9 Pro but comparing a 25MP Cam variant with 16 MP would just be a sin + Add 10k extra price to that of Oppo F9 Pro.  But still, Huawei could have bumped up the Selfie Cam to 20/25 MP for an extra price of 2k.-- 20 MP AI Dual Camera is just a pure delight ! Corner/Edge Correction is good & Bokeh is okayish.Night Mode is very good for the 20MP AI Camera the Huawei has offered. So that kind of equalizes the low of front cam !(*I would any day switch my Honor 6x cam for this 8x)Hence:  3/5  - USAGE & ISSUES -  - This is the part I love with Huawei (Their Own KIRIN Processors) - Absolutely no problems in switching between the apps, Works like a swish ! (*Better than the Snapdragons available in market*)  - No Heating issues on playing games for at the least 45-50 min continuously (*Only my hands get numb -lol*)  - Huawei Cloud Storage is a smart feature to have.  - Fingerprint is 5/5 any day.  - Face Unlock : 4/5So on Usage + Processor - 5/5 for all the loaded features it comes with for a price @ 16k. - Just unbelievable.  - CHARGING - (4/5)  *No fast charging but it takes 2 hours to charge from 2% to 85% (*Impressive according o me)  - SPEAKERS - (4.5/5)  Honor has finally listened to it's subscribers Honor 6x, 7x 7c, Play all lacked a bit in Speakers output & Wow, they have increased the output considerably in this one. So a big Thanks! (*Without compromising on the quality)So OVERALL -(4/5)After my usage I would definitely recommend this phone for people who are budget oriented (like me) but at the same time want a Trustable brand + 6 Gigs of RAM - I bet there is no other phone available to swoop other than this HONOR 8X.Yes, Front Cam is a big let down, so for the ones who say, ""Boss! I am gonna keep showing my face 24*7 infront of my mobile and keep showing that to my followers across the globe & I can shell out 10-15k extra for the same"" - Then this is definitely not your cup of tea !",1
5,"Using this phone for around 18 days and its superb, worth for the 15k..Some people are expecting 30k phone features in 15k.Below are some cons mentioned which make no sense.No 4k recording-People are shooting some big budget movies or what. even if u shoot 90% of phones/laptops give max upto full hd clarity.Speaker not  loud/no dolby or dts-you need to have dedicated home theatres to make use of dolby/dts codecs.. how can you expect a small speaker. to. give theatre effect. Also if these codecs are installed in phone its software wise.. doesnt make any difference if its not there.Camera issue-Agree to this upto some extent as low light clicks are not that great  but still AI is really good.Comparing with other overated chinese brands-Some. people are fans of other brands and trying to compare withthem and degrade..",1
5,"Depending on everyone's expectations and usage it is tough to design a perfect mid-range device because that is where the expectation of most consumers need to be satisfied.Honor 8X is the best mid-range device of 2018Pros -•Clutter free UI. Almoet equivalent to what Google now launcher offers on stock android. EMUI doesn't add bloats and ads like MIUI rather simplifies usage with wonderful built-in features like ScreenCast, Screen Recording, Sound Recorder, health tracking app and other good features.• Front camera is awesome. The portrait mode is fantastic. All features look nice and easy to use. Rear Camera might not be the best one would expect considering how it beats competition in other scenarios but pictures are very good in most cases, even low light.•Battery is decent with screen on time of 10-12 hours on a single charge with video streaming of 3-4 hrs using wifi with Bluetooth headphone.•Phone is snappy, no problem with app launches or lags. Gaming is flawless for normal games. Games like PUBG should be played with medium graphics for best experience.• Dual 4G volte , ie simultaneously using 4G on both SIMs is flawless no speed drop. Kept calling using JIO while using Vodafone for Data.•Dedicated SD card slotCons -• UI update including dialer is an urgent requirement as the UI seems old. Expecting EMUI 9• Rear Camera should have been less grainy more smoothRest in a heavy usage of a week I haven't seen any troubles. It has only contributed to productivity and awesomeness.Without any speck of doubt it is the best mid-ranger of 2018.",1
4,"I have been using honor 8X more than a month. My comments as below.1. Design - Really looks beautiful2. Camera - Packed with lot of features. I feel the portrait mode in rear camera not upto the mark compared to front portrait mode. Need improvement in rear camera portrait mode.3. Sound - By using earphone sound quality is really good, but phone speaker sound is very low. Need improvement in phone speaker sound quality.4. Speed - Really good, no hangover or lagging issues.5. Battery - Really good, solid 1.5 or 2 days with continuous data usage.6. Display - Really good7. Sim Slot - Dual Volte support, most anticipated features finally arrived especially for Jio users. Now you can switch data between both Sim. Both network will be active.8. Budget - Value for money.Recommended this model for customers searching below 15K budget. Trusted model to buy.",1
5,"This is second honor phone I have purchased. First was honor 6x and honor 8x is the second. After using honor 6x I started liking honor phones and was really impressed with performance, battery life and camera. I used honor 6x for more than a year and was really happy with the device.Then came honor 8x in the market. After going through the reviews on YouTube and user reviews on Amazon I decided to buy this.Really this is a worthy upgrade with great camera, superb battery life, awesome looks and smooth performance.In the range of 15 k this is probably the best smartphone.You can take great pictures, play a lot of games and do browsing also but this phone will never say no. It will perform good for you and will last with you full day.",1
5,"Its going to be a long review.The phone is a beauty aesthetics and performance are top notch.1) bodyGlass body has to much pros like the quality of glass by huawei is similar to gorilla glass and dragon tale and give no scratches what so ever in daily use, forget the plastic body that looks and feels cheap and a key would mess it up like khal drogo would mess up literally anything.  Glass is easy to maintain and the dual tone looks ridonculus.It also stops me from using a 3rd party case, phone simply looks fab.2) cameraMany reviews said that the camera was not good bla bla bla bla.I objectThe camera is really great i mean for 15000 i would not expect hassleblad but this stands out. I have a sony m5 with a really really great camera but this one is comparable and color in honor 8x are wayyyyy to more. The Ai really puts good perspective to the pictures and shutter is really fast.TRY THE SLO MOI have uploaded a slow mo in nightTell me your reviews. Night photography pic is also uploaded and is a charm at 10  in the night the pic is bazonkas.Front camera is good in bokeh and focusing and performs well.  THE PICTURE QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING.if you feel the colors are over saturated disable the vivid mode and woila natural but great photos.CAMERA IS DEFINITELY WAY BETTER THAN OTHERS I have moto g4 plus and a couple of redmi notes (4,5,6).3) battery life : i am a battery anxious person so i was a bit nervous regarding the turbo charger missin and  backup. So i compared moto g 4 plus turbo charger and honor 8x charger my self.Turns out turbo charges 1.12% per minute and honkr does it. 95 %per minute, a very little difference between both also the battery of moto is 3000 and honor has 3750.So literally the same,Would charge up from 0-100 in 105-110 minutes and this is not much time.Put the phone to charge, go solve a matrix and as you come back its charged. Puns apart battry life  is good.Just using phone for calls and a bit of whats appIt got me covered for 4 days and i am nkt kidding.Using for gaming and internet extensive work it easily works out till night. And you can still browse 9gag for memes.4) performanceThe ram management was being criticised a bit but believe me you are not going to open close and open close and open close apps that fast as shown in the videos, i mean who would do that in real life? Video in screen and over apps lets you play videos and do funky stuff no problems encountered.The multitasking is good not at all bad.ASPHALT 9 WITH HIGH QUALITY GRAPHICS runs seemlesly altough my phone is already filled with 160 apps (stock including).Game mode does a good job givin all performance it needs.And battery lasts good to 1-2 %approx per race.5) FEATURES  The tiny and great features really makes this phone way fun in customizations.Hiding notch and hiding the navigation bar makes the screen look massive.Gestures and themes are really nice.It even lets you decide if you want fhd or fhd+A whole new world there is for fhd+Some people say it does not have conference, try mergin calls its right there in call screen. And does supports video calls on every app.No body uses video call through dialler.6) SecurityTHE FINGERPRINT READES IS FASTESTYou don't even need to place your fingure, swipe it and its unlocked and pretty decent and never once it denied me with ""not recognised "". Face unlock is also really accurate and fast and recognises me with helmet it learns its way up woth glasses and beard and all the stuff. A real gentle man this phone is.If you like photography go for thisIf you need battery go for itIf you need performance go for itIf you need you tube videos in 1080 p and 1080 iGo for it ( not that common in others)UmmmmIf you need a phone that has stamina of thor, features of iron man, battery  backup of wall e ( realllllly good and like wall e charges real fast too), slim like christian bale in The machinist. Go for this phone.Else haters gonna hatePotatoes gonna potateI have amazing honor 8 (x)P. S as i was writing the reviewBattery charged from 10- 43 percentP.p.s  this review is after 15 days of extensive use.P. P. P. S And the night pic in wothout out flash and at 11 in night use a surface and dont shake the phone, be a pro for photography.P. P. P. P. S  ignore any spelling mistake",1
5,"This is a beast ive been using this for morethan 8 months..No lags, No battery issuesHeating issues are very common but compare to other phones like MiA2 i found this better..UI is somewhat i felt like its a samsung thing ... so if you have used samsung phones earlier you may find its UI similarFace recognition is too good so is the fingerprint sensor2 days ago on 28/3/2019 it got a android pie 9.0 update so you get a updated security patch phone till date...Go on you can trust Huawei's Honor 8XYou can ask any questions if you have any",1
5,You won't get a better-looking phone in this range. Looks premium. Kudos to the display. Excellent battery backup. Triple slot. Good camera and excellent performance. Unmatched in this range of smartphone. Missing a Type C charging is the only thing you can point out. Still the battery backup is remarkably outstanding. Better than phones which has Type C and 4000mah battery.,1
4,The sound quality of Honor 8X is outstanding.. It has a loud sound with amazing clarity. Battery of Honor devices has always been good and so is the case with Honor 8x. I've just upgraded from Honor 6X to 8X just because of its better than others services. Hopefully it'll not hang just like it's predecessors. And support me in using it as my second brain.,1
5,"This phone is value for moneyPros: Sensitive touch  Vibrant display  Very good camera  Latest android  Decent battery life  Powerful build quality  EMUI  Large display  Good eye protection  Fast fingerprint sensor  2+1 sim slot  Good charging speed  Beautiful glass back  Overall good performer  Good gaming  Scrolling screen shot  Low SAR valueCons: Average low light  performance  Portrait is not that great  No duel apps  No secret space  No dark theme  No IR blaster  No double tap wakeup  I have searched and compared many phones and finally got this mobile.  I am a redmi user basically and this phone is far better than redmi mobiles.I'm writing this review after two months usage, I like the display and the camera(daylight) very much. I bought it with a discount offer and I feel it is a great phone at this price.  JAI HIND",1
5,"Have used the phone for a couple of weeks...Let's talk the pros first.1. Amazing build quality, glass biuld looks like a premium phone.2. True dual volte support, in other words you can use two JIO Sim cards at same time.3.Display quality is the best, Very small notch, you can hide it if you don't like the notch. Perfect for media playback.4. Great performance... Best in this range.. Gaming or running multiple apps it bosses, no lag whatsoever5. Battery life is very good... For casual users it will last for about 1.5 days...6. Sound quality is also good. But you have to play with the settings a little bit to get the effects.7. Camera takes some amazing pictures, the secondary camera should have been 5 mega pixels... Can't complain.Cons1. Glass build, attracts finger prints a lot.2. No gorilla glass as usual with honor phones..3. Camera struggles at low light and macro shots..4. No front camera flash, but. Still screen acts as flash.5. No fast charging, with the provided charges it takes 2.5 hrs for full charge.A must buy phone I would say at this price point...Use it with a tempered glass and good case if you don't want to break it...",1
4,"To be honest, I am really suprised to get a smartphone with this specifications and build at this price range. The specification is top notch (please refer the product description in Amazon page), without compromising the quality in the components used. The build of the phone is awesome, and looks extremely pleasing (I had ordered the Blue one).Now for the cons of the phone - The Camera quality is a bit compromised in spite of good amount of Megapixels and a secondary camera for depth focusing. Low light performance, likewise is abysmal. Another con is the sound quality from the speaker. Even at the max volume it allows, the sound is low as compared to its counterparts of Mi and other devices.Apart from the two cons I mentioned above, didn't find any other mentionable cons in the phone. Played heavy graphics intensive games for straight 2 hours and it didnt heat up a bit. It is awesome at this price and definitely recommended if you are looking for a smartphone in this range. A outer shell is recommended, as the phone looks very delicate and you of course don't want to take a chance.",1
5,"👍👌👍Go for honor 8x guys, Best quality mobile better than honor play mobiles!!! 3700mah battery performs well!sound quality is also perfect enough for its single speaker!!!camera quality is best but while zoom you will see the pixel quality losses!! Other than dual 4G and VoLTE supports working fine! Its screen size is also little bigger than honor play models!!this model includes Ride mode, party mode, Huawei share options etc!!!dual Bluetooth is not available, but it beats honor play model mobiles and cost effective!!!seperate SD card slot is super! IT DOESN'T SUPPORT OTG DRIVES!!!! That's it guys, go for it, worth for money... 👍👍👍👌👌👌",1
5,To be very honest it is my first honor mobile and iam a normal user I was looking for big display and I found honor 8x then I have watched all reviews and YouTube videos then finally I have ordered.

Sound is good acceptable. Camera is good for me as I told nowmal user.Now the performance is upto the mark it is better than redmi note 5 Pro and very smooth while usingSo finally it is overall good mobile to pick yes few cons are their but I don't thing that matters for me. And if you want to know about that cons you can watch YouTube videos. So finally I will suggest you to buy thise wonderful deviceI hope I was able to help you Thise is my  first mobile review.,1
4,I'm using this phone for almost more than 15 days. It is a very good looking phone at this price range . The battery life is awesome. The pic quality is good but not great . Sound quality is also Ok. Overall performance is awesome no lags. The phone heats up while charging and camera quality should be improved through software updates and it doesn't have EIS . Lastly the phone takes almost two and half hours for charging completely. At this price segment I think this the best phone. Overall I love this phone very much.,1
5,"I never review any products but this product in particular has compelled me to do so.This device in my opinion is the best smartphone in the 15k segment.One of the best performers while gaming, super smooth UI, and even get an option to enable app drawer. With all of that said, this phone has the best front camera and one of the best rear facing cameras in this segment. The only con this camera has is that it doesn't have EIS, there is a possibility that we may get that in future updates. So not that big of an issue for me at least.And reviewers on YT have said that this phone's speaker isn't upto the mark. Whereas in my opinion it's great, yes it has a single speaker but it's quite loud. If I compare the speaker with Redmi Note 5 pro's dual speakers then it obviously has lower volume. That is expected when you are comparing two speakers with one, but it still is loud and if anyone says that you might have problems in hearing the ringtone then that person or reviewer must be lying. Ringtone is loud enough to be heard clearly even on Delhi's roads.And last but not the least, the biggest plus point of this device is its display and its looks. This device doesn't just look premium but it feels premium too and the massive 6.5 inch fhd+ display is beautiful, again the best in the segment. Nokia 6.1+ might come close in the display & looks department though.The colours are well saturated and by default they are quite vibrant, if you don't like vibrant colours then you change that in display settings by simply selecting the normal settings.And idk why people complain about notch displays, I loved the notch display. If you prefer a notchless display then you can simply disable it from the settings. It's quite neat imo. And a few other things I forgot to talk about are the bezels on this device are almost negligible, it has triple sim slot with dual 4G VOLTE. Great signal reception and ohh one thing I really wanted, which is the multicolor notification light, in the notch. So having a notch is not really an acceptable excuse to exclude the notification led.Overall I am in love with this device and everything about it, if anyone is looking for a great smartphone in the 15k price bracket then go for this you won't regret. And use the case provided in the box as this phone has a glass back!",1
4,"CameraAdvantage:superb and awesome for this price... Ai shots are are more colourful..Disadvantage:no eis, ais, 4k....Battery life : worthy for this amountDisplay: FHD+ display superb claritySound: ok not poor and it is good through headphone jackPerformance : honor 8x gives a best performance with kirin 710 its better than snapdragon 660...gaming is superb.. Heating is slightly appeared but not very noticeable...Main disadvantage : honor didnt gave corning gorilla glass protection for the display... And no c type are the main disadvantage....",1
5,"Superb Mobile in 15000 range. Compare to Real me 2 pro and MI note 5 pro, cost is little bit more but this is great device.back camera quality is excellent, front camera is also excellent but in indoor condition pictures are noisee, this is only software problem, I use beauty plus me to resolve these problem and using beauty plus me front camera is flawless superb pic quality I seen.Processor is great gives superb performance and optimisation is great specially for battery life.Also battery life is very very good of Honor 8X I have seen. I used it for 1.8 days after charging it tp 100%.2 days battery life when using it more than average.Great mobile friends.",1
4,"Almost 1 year completed using this phone. Everything remains as it is inside nothing changed neither speed nor battery life.Playing Games on it without any heating issue which I faced earlier on my two different phones.Picture quality is perfect.Video quality is good, I have started a youtube channel by using only this phone.I am using Honor 7x for my photo and video shoot work also.This phone is something you can experience yourself no other can define it better than you as per your purpose.",1
5,"Writing this review after a weeks usage.Camera is good or above par at this price range. The colour reproduction is very good but the pics seems a bit over saturated. The front camera is also good. Both are good at low lights too. The night is a great addition to already great camera.Battery life is also good. As i'm not a gamer, it lasts enough for me. The battery consumption management of the EMUI is very good.As we are coming to the display, It is awesome. It looks as if we are holding only  the display in our hands. The screen is made as vivid as it can be. But i felt that near the notch and at the down end of the display, some pixels doesn't seem to have been lit properly. But it is noticable at white backgrounds only.The looks of the phone gives the feel that you are holding a premium phone. The dual tones at back side is amazing.Sound is loud enough. But not clear enough.Fast charging is missing but 10w charger does the job.Considering the money you pay for it, It is THE BEST you can get.Thank you Honor.",1
5,I LOVE THIS MOBILE AND THIS IS THE BEST MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN BUY IN THIS PRICE RANGE. FULLY LOADED WITH ALL THE FEATURES AND MADE WITH NICE AND PREMIUM QUALITY MATERIAL. THIS IS THE BEST BUY,1
5,Best phone to buy under 15k category only fast charging missing,1
5,"The picture quality on this phone is nothing short of baffling. At this price range, giving out such great pictures is awesome.Also, the Display is awesome. The viewing angles make it a better deal. The colour production is just amazing.The sound quality is good on the better part. However, the sound from the speaker could be a bit less when compared to other devices. However, that's not a deal breaker as you get the earphone jack to connect your earphones and go on a trip.The battery life is just amazing. The 3750 mAh battery just saves a lot of your charge when not using. A medium usage of phone could last upto two days. On a heavy usage, your phone could still last for a day.Heavy gaming heats up the phone a bit however most of the part you won't notice any heating at the rear side.",1
5,"This is the best value for money product.Picture quality is decent with good details warm colors. You can take some seriously good selfies.Sound of this device is a mixed bag but it's loud enough.When u come to battery department it will blow your mind. The 12nm processor shown the magic here. For heavy to heavy user it will last for one day, for heavy user little more to a day for moderate user it will stay with you for one and half days to two days. It won't regret you for sure in battery area.Performance is outstanding. No complain with day to day life. It handles multitasking easily. Processing speed ram management also good. Actually the the new Kirin710 is doing absolutely phenomenal.Software is Android Oreo 8.0 holding EMUI 8.2.0 on its top which loaded with tons of features. It will give a pleasant experience to your life from the mobile world. Nothing complicated to use this OS as some of the players in market doing their OS unnecessarily complicated.Finally the best part of the mobile is DESIGN...making this capital due to it will make you stand out of the crowd. U can't feel the real beauty of this mobile until unless you are not going to hold it on ur palm. In paper it looks good but with naked eye it will blow your mind. Once you will open the box and saw this beauty that's all, you will start fall in love with it. Thanks for the silicone cover bundled with the product as this is a must buy. Bcoz of the glass design u should be more careful and attentive, or else it will be ended with a heart breaking situation which surely you don't want.After all this is a recommended mobile for the price Huawei set for it. You can go with this by closing your eyes. It never let you down.",1
5,"Writing a review after 10 days of usage phone is just awesome... Very good processor I don't feel any hang problem till now.. Battery life is just excellent.. The phone looks premium in hand, it is very easy to read pdf due to it's massive 6.5 inch screen.. Also watching movies feel great in 6.5 inch screen there is option called themes in this phone from that you can able to choose a good looking theme for your phone.. Also I don't feel any stress on my eyes till now..the phone automatically adjust brightness according to availability of light, and I don't know why people are shouting for speakers the sound is enough and loud and clear for specific person There are some problems also I faced like camera is not that good... Also phone struggling to capture slow motion videos overall if you want a premium phone in your hand with good processor and big 6.5 inch screen then definitely go for it.. If you wants to capture good photos then I think mi phones like mi a1, a2 and note 5 Pro will be a better choice now choice is yours according to me ( agar apko camera jyada matter nahi karts air above average photos se aap khush ho jate ho to ye phone aapke liye hi bana he log kate hue apple ko dekhkar pachas saath hazar rs kharch kar dete he to ek premium phone hath me lena chahte ho to honor 8x best he)I hope that honar will provide a update regarding camera.. Because if we show photos to someone from your honor 8x then no one will believe that the picture is taken from 20 mega pixel camera",1
5,"Display- Awesome viewing angles, crisp and sharp.Sound- Single firing speaker but adequately loud. Of course not the best.Camera- above average rear camera. Good image quality. Over exposed images. Saturation levels are high.Secondary camera is good but beauty effects applies and cannot be turned off. Sharp selfies but colour saturation high and real colours turned vibrant.Battery - is amazing. Charging is pretty fast as compared to other 5v 2amp chargers.Build quality- is awesome and feels premium specially blue colour.Processor - Kirin 710 is good i think somewhat near to 910 no lags but minor bugs. Perhaps can be sorted with OTA update.Overall value for money.",1
5,"I am using this phone for two days and phone looks very decent in terms of specifications.  Screen and Battery (I got for 1 day 20h for moderate use) is very good.. and some disappoint in Picture quality (back camera) and Speaker sound.  Rear camera gives more colour especially red and Speaker sound in not much louder as compare to Mi phones.  If Honor try to fix this two, this is a wonderful phone in the segment in this range.  Overall this phone is very good and the above two issues are minor.  And the size is perfectly ok.  thanks Honor.. and Amazon (for prompt delivery)",1
5,Pros:-Great build quality.Screen quality also good..Lag free experience..Camera awesomeBattery backup is very good..Cellular network speed is better than any other mobile..Cons:-USB type C..With AI mode picture quality is over saturated..More fast charging..I must recommend you to buy it with decent price👍,1
5,"Great phone in the segment though is sucked to see that it went down by 1000 just after 2 weeks of purchase to 13k. the phone is great and it's battery is left more than half in the evening after a routine day better than my previous redmi which had 4400mah battery. Gpu performance is awesome and it plays pubg great in medium settings. Camera is kind of OK and you can videochat without any lighting in a dark environment. Also the design is awesome, anyone can think that this is much costlier than a 14k phone. I'll surely suggest it to anyone who's looking for a phone in this range.",1
5,"I don't regret at all after purchasing this phone. It's perfect in almost all segments considering its mid range segment. The best part is battery and performance which is better than any other phone available in same range. I have been Huawei user since last 7 years and haven't faced any issue till now. For those who are whining in the name of camera, I suggest to go and buy dslr. Let phones be phones and cameras be cameras.One feature that I initially thought present was missing which is DLNA(to share files over devices connected over network) but that's okay. I recommend to buy this one rather any other brand solely on  the basis of product quality.Amazon_ as always good delivery service.",1
5,"Review after using for one month. In this price range, you can rely on Honor 8X as it delivers the best performance till now. As well as the camera quality is also good especially in AI mode. Battery backup is also very good as one full charge will last 3 days with normal use(till 0%), with gaming still you can make it to 2 days battery power. Performance wise you can play high-end games (PUBG, MORTAL KOMBAT X, INJUSTICE 2, ASPHALT 9 etc) without any lagging. No heat issue as of now.",1
5,"This phone is very underrated.No other phone has display as big as this beast ( in this price point). Camera Quality is Good and there are tons on features.Kirin 710 is well optimized for performance and battery.Pros :1. Big (6.5 inches) And Crisp Display.2. Battery Backup3. Performance (no heating).4. Good Cameras and lots of camera features.5. Android PieCons :1. No fast charger in the box.2. EMUI ( but better than other UIs like MIUI, ColorOS, etc)3. No 4k recording till now.",1
5,"Amazing phone it's totally a value for money product. Totally premium in looks and also in features. Talking about the camera, AI is totally awesome. Even the selfie shooter is a beast based on your photography skills. The glass back is damn premium and the display is killer full HD. The camera has alot of features AR is inbuilt and also has slowmo. The sound quality​ is better but there are few best in the market and the battery backup is good not the best tho it lasts a long day even I use for office use but what's to worry about the fast charging is damn awesome. Over all I want to say I'm happy with my phone it's totally amazing driver, I really love it. Thanks Honor 😊",1
5,This phone is amazing for the money. Great for gaming. Meets all my needs. The camera is average in low light but does good in well lit conditions. Durable as well. I've dropped it countless times with no cover and it has survived with no problem. I've always been a Samsung fan boy but not anymore. This is way better  than any Samsung phone in this price range.,1
5,"I researched a lot before buying this phone as it was my 1st Honor phone. I compared with Mi note 5pro, poco F1, Samsung A7 and some honor phones themselves. I already have Mi Note 5 Pro.. but believe me i am loving using this phone. Its so easy to handle, lovely and premium design, screen size(very lil bezel) just give i-phone type look. Camera is good(i would give 3.5 stars) in daylight but very good in low light. Battery life is almost 2 days and processor is also very fast. Will definitely recommend buying this phone in the range below 20,000.",1
5,"Before I bought this Honor 8x mobile I was a big fan of Samsung mobile phones. After I bought this product I became a ardent fan of Honor and Huawei mobile phones. I love the screen, AI camera, face recognition, finger print scanner, low light photography, processor and image stabilisation. Very good and quality product from Huawei. Kudos to Huawei for bringing this Honor 8x mobile with so many features and reasonable price to afford. In future if I will to purchase a new mobile phone definitely I will go for Huawei and Honor mobile phones through Amazon. Thanks again to Huawei for the product. Thanks to Amazon for bringing good and excellent products to the customers.",1
5,"Awesome product from Huawei. *Very* Long battery life, Mark the word very... I mean it.Camera is good too. Night mode, light painting are some good features that most of the phones in this range don't get.Pubg runs like a rocket, no lags or what so ever. Its buttery smooth and makes the gameplay really really easy.Picture quality is awesome too.The best thing about the display is that u can choose to have Hd display or FULLHD+ according to ur preference.U can even hide the notch if u don't like it. (I love the notch). The phone is really fast.One thing which disappointed me is the sound quality as well as the sound volume.Its not high or good enough as compared to my old redmi note 5 Pro or Even other phones of its segment.Else 8X rocks...!!!",1
5,Pros:- 1 awesome design2 - good battery life3 - notch is better than pixel 3xl4 - lovely back panel5 - dual camera6 - face unlock is working well7 - EMUI is optimized8 - speed is better than 7x9 - camera is also goodCons -1 micro usb2 heating if you play for very long time (not in the 7x),1
4,"I started using this in November 2018 and 3 months later,here I  am.Iliked the affordability  and 6.5 inches long (display with a rectangular notch) the blue colour is so appealing to the eye. Initially the battery lasted for about one and a half-day; later on a day. I guess it has to do something with me not using the new honor charger that was in the package.( Shouldn't have used my old charger)Photos and videos are decent. For someone like me who doesn't take a lot of high quality pictures for social media, I'm more than okay with this phone. However if the only criteria for your phone is high quality pictures, the ones on par with pixel or Samsung note, definitely don't even consider this phone. This phone's alright for pictures here and there, decent camera and brightness.",1
4,"A nice device to select from Honor series.You can surely go with the New Honor 8x- The Beast In Kind Gadget.*Be careful in caring the mobile as it will be big in our hands....*Firstly, we should get a best or better mobile case for it in order to avoid accidental breakages and damages as it will be somewhat difficult to hold it all the times perfectly...Picture Quality:Rear Cmaera:The rear camera 📸 performance has to be upgraded as it is executing a layer of blur and pixel break in the images..But we can overcome it by changing the camera and picture settings or even change to aperture mode and pro mode.Note:- 1. In order to Keep the focus in a right place, and to avoid picture blur and out of focus elements, keep an eye on the exact place to keep the object or the person in the correct place and avoid zooming the lens instead move the device to get close or far from the object.2. Always Touch on the screen to detect the focus on the object or on the person to be shooter.3. Don't go for bokeh mode(so how better for selfies and the front camera) and AI Preferences for all the types of images you are capturing as it gives you an unpleasant and negative thought on the camera.. Instead check whether you are in need to use them or not..4. Always avoid using beauty level to get good and natural stuff.5. Better to prefer Pro mode and manually select the parameters to get good and quite awesome pictures.Front Camera:The front camera is designed with 16MP Megapixel with good support of bokeh effect. Good among all the competitive range of devices.Sound Quality: It's atmost a good experience for the sound quality perspective but sometimes, in my personal opinion and feelings, I heard the audio of the media files and songs as a base volume which we observe in a closed room or a small closed areas.Battery Life: It is quite enough for the users but as we are basically humans don't agree with what we have but expect a lot beyond the presence..",1
5,"This is the best phone in this price segment, battery is very good, with moderate use can stay for more than a day. Picture quality is comparable to any premium phone. Sound quality is not as compare to lenovo dolby, this is not a issue as we hardly use to listen music using phone sound. If you are not a professional photographer then you will like the camera also, which is good for our daily use. Don't worry about negative reviews and go for this",1
4,"I've been using honor 8x from a month now. All i can say is decent phone under this price segment. Camera is somewhat average. Sound quality from audio jack is also not upto the mark. Battery life is awesome as compared to other 3750mah devices. I can easily play 4-4.30 hours of PUBG in HD HIGH settings. And the gaming experience is awesome with this phone. You will not notice any kind of lag while playing. Yes there are heating issues but it is not that mojor. But THE LOOKS OF THIS PHONE IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS PHONE. What a beaty honor produced. Very nice looks. Feels very premium in hand. And it's glass back attracts fingerprints but no scratches. It has very nice quality back glass. I have bought RED color and it feels magical to me. All i can say if you have priority of camera and music then this device is not for you. But if you ignore these two things then this device is total beast. Some people think that it's a old device to purchase now, but i must tell you that ANDROID 9.0 IS STARTED TO ROLL OUT for this device. So choice is yours. I personally liked this device very much. Love you honor. Please click like button if you find my review helpful.",1
4,"Honor 8x..I has a awsome 6.5 inch display which makes sense to watch better videos, gaming etc ....With its bezel less design ie., 91%screen to body ratio makes the device to look better.Kirin 710 with 2.2 ghz processor done its work greatly...anyhow the power GPU of the chip is somewhat low but its not a problem..it has a gpu turbo....Potraits, night shots are impressive. Slow motion has only 480p resolution so it makes little dissapointment...Equaliser is not that good...u can use some best equaliser from the play store...Battery backup is amazing that it gives the capacity of 4500 mAh eventhough it is 3750 mAh..Overall..Pros...CameraBatteryProcessorDesignCons...Audio is not that audibleGaming is nott sooo good bcoz of mali G51 GPU...But u can play PUBG much smoother...as in my point of view...Go for it if you need all rounder ....It is better to buy as comparing to asus max pro m2...it has lot of bugs...Asus buggy mobile...",1
5,"I can just say, wow. For a phone like this in 15k is worth a deal.Display is awesome😍.Camera is satisfactory.Battery life is  too good.Speakers are good too but need to be improved.Gaming experience is awesome without any lag or heating issue.And last but not the least, the Design, no smartphone can match its design, even the ones in the higher range.All in all it's the best smartphone in this segment.",1
5,"Thanks Amazon for fast delivery...No issue facing ......product is awesome........go for it ..... 1.Camera is good (4.1* )2.Battery is good(4.6*)3.Build Quality(5*)4.Amazing OS(EMUI)BUT Honor does not gives regular google security patches,that's only the downside5.Display(5*)6.Notch simply perfect(5*)7.Kirin 710(awosome) (4*)But little bit lagy while gaming comparing to 660SD",1
4,"I bought this phone around 3 weeks back, I heavily played PUBG without using any network. Battery life is better than Xiaomi's 4000mah, but still didn't meet my expectation. If I play PUBG with my own 4G Volte network, then battery could drain even more faster. Graphics is good in this phone, no complaint about it till now. Screen is good with more vibrant colours and good screen to body aspect ratio.Camera performance with good lighting condition do not stands out of crowd, but night camera is really good.Selfie is mediocre with less amount of details, media consumptions in this device is a pleasure for those who always want to surf YouTube video contents.Overall build quality is attractive enough to grab everyone's attention.If your more into gaming and consume lot of video content, then this might be a good option. If your priority is more towards camera, then please don't go for it.There of lot of options available in the market for the same price tag.I hope this review might of cleared all your doubts, thank u",1
5,"Soon as you turn on the screen the reaction is 'wow',Awesome screen, it's so big, covers most of the front body,the chin is so small.FHD+ screen makes it a treat for the eyes.Turn the device over and u are greeted with a shining sparkling glass back which although is a fingerprint magnet but looks so cool that u would never complain. This device is so beautiful and look better than most phones in this price rangeVery good battery life almost lasts more than one day on moderate to high usage.Performance wise the Kirin 710 is so good. Almost comparable to SD636 or SD660.Games like PUBG,Asphalt 9 runs smoothly without any lags whatsoeverOne interesting thing to note is that, There is a dedicated SD card slot along with 2 SIM card slots, which would allow u to insert 2 SIM Cards and an SD card at the same time which is usually absent in many present devices.The speakers are not that loud but they are totally decent and fits the profile also the headphone jack though present could have been a bit louder.Camera is the only incompetent thing in this device.The picture quality is avarage on both front and back and there is a bit more preprocessing that gets done on the photo on both front and back cameras.AI feature is great but the photos lack a natural look and sometimes look edites. There is no 4k video support,60Fps video or OIS and EIS.I will recommend this device to anyone who wants to buy a mid range phone under 20k.The device come pre applied with a screen protector and also has a clear case in the box",1

The main thing about this phone is the best design in the mid range market it's just out of this world5. FACE LOCK and Fingerprint sensors is very quick and secure6. The Ui is very very optimized and Smooth7. Camera is good and The AI feature is very usefullCons1. There is no fast charging in this device and it takes long time to charge2. Sometimes the pictures captured are not so good.3. There nothing too many Cons in this deviceIt's Overall a Perfect Device for all user but in photos it doesn't Compete with other in the budget.,1
4,"Its the best value for money after honor play, pocco f1 and one plus6  pubg runs smoothly on high settings with powerful 12 nm chip kirin 710. Battery life is so better considering its 6.5 inch display. Camera is also the best around 15 k. But it doesn't have EIS but that problem is solved through stablizing option in google photos and microusb. All around the best phone",1
5,"Amazing phone. Buy without a second thought. Looks very premium in hand but very delicate to use as back side is made of glass and it has a big screen. Those people who use phone roughly should not buy this. If u can carry this phone with proper care it is the best phone within 15 k. Battery 🔋 is superb. Display is amazing. User interface is very good. Does the work very fast what is given to it. Thank u to Kirin 710 processor. Picture quality is very good, but the people who like natural pictures will dislike the pictures taken by it. It produces already edited pictures, there comes no necessity to editing after capturing. As far as the con is concerned I can tell that it has not fast charging and special attention should be given during handling of this phone. The sound output is a little bit less compared to other rivals of this range. Above all a good package.",1
4,"This phone is a power pack of design, built quality,camera, battery ,value for money etc,If you love to shoot a video then this phone is not for you, lacks IES stabilisation, video quality is good but it shakes alot which is not suitable for video recording. But stationary video recording is OK.Other than this,  the body made of glass which can be easily broken once you drop or fall down incase.The back and screen glass were very brittle.Camera quality is  not that good as compared to other phone with same range of price...i xan camera is worse than mi phones and realme 2 pro camera is better",1
5,Got the phone for 13.5K and i have been using it for 1 week. The phone is fabulous. Awesome build and display compared to all other phoned in this price range. The 3750mah battery gives a decent backup and can easily make through the day. The Honor Interface is better looking than the other Mi or Moto Interfaces. All together its the best you can get in this price range.,1
5,"After 4years of succecful usage of  huawei p8 lite i exchange that  phone  and owned honor 8x. It's  a great looking  and stunning  performance phone from honor, sub brand of  huawei. Batter  life  and picture  clarity  is  very  good. Works  with  huawei's own  chip set  and  emui. Huawei  is  the  world  second  android  phone  manufactur . Samsung  is  the  top. Vivo, oppo  and  realme  are  kacharra. Why  people  invest  money  to  the  stuppid  phones.?.  Hi  guys  u  need  a great  phone  under 20 k no  doubt  go  for  it. But  the  audio  clarity  is  average  compare  my  old  phone. And  no  hed phone  available  in  the  package. Amazon  service  is  very  good. Thanks  amazon",1
5,"First of all Thanks for amazon, for delever the product before expected time. The honor 8x is the best performing and good looking device. The looks is awsome and sound quality, camera,  picture, and AI system is the best. Battery life is very very good. Overall the phone is best in this price range. No one competitors for honor 8x in this price range.",1
4, Good phone with great performance and premium looking design. Good battery life. It will give you one day usage even if you play pubg for a while. No need to worry about battery. Camera is not as expected quality but it is fine. Those pictures are original images without any edit. Good sound quality. But honor 8x can't record vedio in 1080p format. It is very disappointing. The glass is not gorrilla. Pubg and other high graphics games can play smoothly. Overall it is worth for money. Better than realme 2 think.,1

4,Horrible speed as compared to my 2 year old MI phone Redmi 3s. I don't know what thes honor people do. My Redmi 3s performs much better when I slide the 100 images in file manager. Honor 8X lags there as compared to a Rs. 3k phone Redmi 3s.Mid range smartphones-Go only for MI.I think Redmi note 5 would be far better than these Realme 2 pro & honor 8x.,1
5,"Excellent product, very smooth, Battery life is also good",0
5,Picture quality is good when compared with price. Don't compare with high end phones. Battery life was amazing. Gives me 8 hours of SOT with normal usage and even with 3 hours pubg sot was 5 - 6 hours.Display quality was awesome. Touch is great. Speaker volume and quality is ok but not that good.Full charge took 2 hours.Overall very good choice at this price range.,1

4,"Everyone in my family owns mi smartphone. I wanted something different this time.Let's talk about cons;1. Front camera is below average. Rear camera is decent but not natural colours.2. No EIS/OIS. Camera and video stability is missing.3. Soud is not loud in earphone.4. Speaker sound khul kar nahin aa rahi hai. Sound output is irritating.5. MIUI theme is better than EMUIOtherwise, this is a good phone at this price.Please hit like if this was helpful.",1

4,"I've been using this for almost 2 weeks now. The battery life is okay.... Not too great, lasts about 1 day with regular use. The display and camera quality is great but the camera lacks image stabilisation so taking a clear pic becomes a chore sometimes, practice makes perfect. Sound is good but and loud, can get distorted sometimes. The performance and quality is pretty good and it works better than expected, worth the money",1

4,First of all I got the phone on time as mentionedThe think I like about the phone is the looks and build quality. It feels premium and have a large and beautiful 6.5 inch screen. I like each and every bit of it.But the thingI didn't like is the saturation level it make everything more colourfull which I didn't like. And it does not have image stabilisation.But other than the phone is badasss....,0

Would fall in luv with the large vibrant display. Camera could be better particulaly in low light. The AI camera also pretty good for automatic mode. Got it in 12.5k during the Great Indian Festival and was pleasantly surprised by all the specs.,1

5,"Great phone overall, I've had it for 4 months now and can recommend this to anyone on budget. The battery life still holds up to the first few weeks and lasts a bit more than 24 hours on high usage. The camera quality is amazing but the portrait mode is not the best l. The bokeh effect is very finnicky and can make or break the pictures. I haven't come across any major heating issues and the phone is supported by regular Google and Honor Updates.",1

It runs smoothly.",1
5,"It exceeded my expectations at this price. It has been recommended by my two friends who are using Honor brand from last 3 years and they are more than satisfied. So i gave it a try. Being a photographer, initially I didn't expected much but it really has great  quality image. Strongly recommended.P. S. Added few sample photos from its rear camera.",0
4,"It's been more than two weeks, am using this phone. I gave up on lenovo owned moto and bought this phone. Must say, it was a wise decision to move to Huawei brand. The processor Kirin 710 in it is the masterpiece of this gadget. This phone gives great user experience when it comes to touch interface. One day charge and I used YouTube for 4 hours also played few games for 30 minutes and attended calls and messages for an hour almost, battery was well managed to be drained only 30% approx. Great phone at this price.",1

4,"Considering the price range, I would say this is one of the best mobile. I have been a user of the most premium phones in market till date since last 14 yrs. But this phone didn't disappoint me. Display, camera, processor and battery all complement its amount. Only improvement which I would suggest is that the UI can be more smooth like Samsung devices. The product received was in very good condition, credit to the seller.This device is 10K less than Vivo V11 pro and Oppo F9 pro, but after comparing all features I would suggest to buy Honor 8x and save 10K.",1
5,"Many people and friends troll me, for this product. They every time told me to purchase xiaomi (redmi) product. But I purchased this. And I am happy to have it ! Great camera quality. sound quality wanted to improve more (but not bad in quality). Speed was great also. I haven't play game on it, so I can't say the gaming performance; But, i think it will be also good for gaming. Face recognizasio was also too good. Selfie camera's face detection need to to be little improve. And, last but the not least... LOOK WAS MIND BLOWING !!",0
4,I brought 2 mobiles the sale. Redmi 6 pro for my dad and honor 8x for me.

5,You guys will love the phone with it's mesmerizing looks and amazing battery life. Though I am not a speaker phone mode lover. I like listening to music using earphones so happy with the sound quality as others complain of low sound quality. Happy with the purchase and recommended to others also. You will observe it's beast (processor) performing at it's best in couple of days after you use. As AI takes time to adapt ur habits of using phone.,1

NO Fast charging. At least It should have support of fast charging.device is good compare to other in  same range.,1
5,"This is an excellent phone with a superb battery life. I am not so much into photography so the camera quality is more than satisfactory for me. Little dissapointed by the sound quality of external speaker, gives more like a hollow sound.The interesting piece of the phone is Huawei's Emui platform which is by far the beat i have used. Would definitely recommend if you ar looking a high config phone within 20k range.",0
5,"All rounder phone ever i seen yet. It's big screen is just awesome with full HD+. Many of you see that it doesn't come with type c port with fast charging but guys if you replace your official charging adapter with mi 20,000 mAh power bank that this phone got charge very fast. I m using this with mi power bank instead of charging by original charger. Although this will not blow up with high speed charging but it will charge faster than adopter.For games just play hard this will not show any lag on pubg on high setting. No heating at all.",0
4,After a lot of consideration I decided to go ahead with Honor 8X...My first ever Honor phone..I must say Honor has launched the best phone in this segment & it will surely take away the market share from competitors soon... A pair of good earphone & decent back cover would have added more joy to the overall experience..Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery.. JUST LOVED IT!! ❤️,1
5,I was watching for a good and budget  handset which can give me better gaming performance and fantastic camera. Then i found this beast Honor 8x. I have used it since 1 month.

Other camera clarity & options are good",1

5,"Awesome phone nothing to say about this phone i am just loving it, the battery life is mind blowing as gives 2days battery backup even i am travelling in train , but some minor issues with front facing camera it is not exposing natural colour tone on pics a yellowish tone is appearing on the pics in other hand rear camera is doing a great job in clicking pics . Thanks Honor team for this device in this price range 😘",0
5,"Camara quality very nice and looking are fabulous...Sound quality low to compair mi mobile but same sound quality to compared to OPPO and vivo, Samsung....Only one setting are not satisfied me, the all dual app not allow in this phone only Facebook, whatsapp, tweeter are allowed",1
5,Market is flooded with many smartphone but they come with fake glass like finish but it has real beautiful glossy glass back panel and looks absolutely stunning and with kirin 710 as expected its highly efficient and powerful and moreover 3750 battery takes battery life to another levelDisplay is very bright and crisp no complainsFast charging and good sound quality is lacking..Overall perfect buy,0
4,Display quality of this phone quite good but captured pictures quality of this phone not as up to the mark low light performance isn't good some noisy substances visible while taking pictures on night or low light. Lack of Naturality of pic taken by both camera primary or secondary it's seems more artificial than natural. Other wise except this things overall the performance is good. Anyone can go with this device as good budget phone,0
5,It feels like a flagship phone in budget pricing.. Impressed by the face id and potrait mode..low light camera is not that efficient..4k display..the battery last upto 2 days even on using internet..and luks so stunning,0

Back glass panel gives very awesome and primium looks.",0
4,"It's perfect phone for those who want big display, with all the features.Battery is very good due to its kirin 710 processor,  with the power efficiency.Camera is also great no issues but in videos you will miss 4k recordingOn the other side it has super slow motion in it.Happy with the purchaseWriting review after 3 weeks of usage....",0
5,"Massive display, full HD, excellent design, superior build quality, way more features than you can expect at this price range for a mid range phone, truly worth the price. But let me use it for sometime so that I can certify the performance. Plastic back cover quality is very bad. White powders coming after few weeks use.",0
4,"Pros-1. Display is awesome2. Camera is good can be better in low lighting though3. Kirin 710 processor4. Screen to body ratio will blow your mind.5. Brilliant design an appearance of back panel.Cons-1. Not a C- type port2. No fast charging3. No Eis4. Notification are not optimised properly to show along noth, they just get skipped at notch area.",0
5,"Mobile have best picture quality, Video Recording quality which can control noise pollution. Battery is excellent and the charger is not speed charger. It will take 2.30 hrs to completed 100%. Front and back camera is good on day and night time also. Processor is best and I have tryed almost every game and it will run successfully. The Faceunlock and Finger print sensors are very fast.Overall I will give 9 out of 10 to this product. 9/10.",1
5,"Battery life is quite good and impressive and the charging speedDiplay is really good and vibrant, the screen is just bigger but can be operate by one handCamera quality is also impressive AI feature automatically enhances the colour quality which is goodIn short its just one of the best mid range flagship phone",1
4,"An absolute package of style and performance... Battery is 3750mah but when compared with redmi note 6 pro and pubg gameplay, surprisingly it lasted almost equal to the 4000mah battery of redmi note 6 pro because of its emui and the optimisation it has..But there is a minus point that it doesn't come with any  protection like gorilla glass or anything. Just a glass sandwich unibody. It gets cracked even fallen from the height of 4 feet.",1
4,"The phone looks really good, sound quality is nice, display is very good especially 6.5"" full display. The batter life excellent and i could use entire day with just one time charge. Use the phone cover to avoid finger print marks. Good value for the money.",0
5,"Camera is excellent under natural light, under low light it is not that good but best in this price range. Sound is great, it has its own system to enhance the experience depending upon the earphone type but speaker isn't the loudest. Best feature of this phone is Battery. It lasts whole day even with moderate gaming and YouTubing.Its something that you should buy if you're looking for a budget buy",1
4,Size of the phone is too big for my liking rest everything is good. Despite having big hands I find it bit uneasy to operate it with one hand. Camera can be improved through software updates. Sound output is decent through headphones as well as speakers. Battery life is pretty good. Design and built quality is best in this price segment.Overall good phone to buy but if you don't like big phones then avoid it.,1
4,Using Honor phones since Honor 6X. At this price there are lot of options to choose from but this phone stands out. The screen is humongous and rest specs are really cool. The reflective blue back colour is a head turner.EOD: Happy,0
4,Huawei y2019 is the best to compare of Honor 8x. Also Redmi 6 and Asus Max Pro m2 or realme 3 as well.,1
5,"I first time order a smartphone from Amazon. And when I received my parcel, I was a bit disappointed as the plastic bag's seal was a bit torn. However, I accept it to see what happen next, but fortunately, I got a good smartphone. It works amazing. Even better than my previous Le2. Camera, handling & performance are great.

5,The Look Is OMG so good. The Back Glass Reflection is Fabulous. Using it since it first released. The Camera is Okay Does The Job. Front is better imo. The Battery Life Is Decently Good like 8~9 of continous on screen time.only con i have is the vibration doesn't work properly but that's due to the fact i dropped it really hard twice tho. and the emui is trash btw use nova launcher to get the things done,0
5,"Been waiting for almost 2 years for a phone which had triple slots and performed admirably. Well, Om happy. The battery is awesome..UI is great..and camera is above average. Gaming is also great.

The build quality is EXCELLENT. Put the case on tho. The screen is super good too, basically, mostly all the pros on all the reviews are what I love about this beast. Though, if you have L shaped earphones, charging and listening to music is a pain. A tiny con but nonetheless, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND GO FOR IT.",0
5,Best in this price range.. Don't waste your time to look for any better device in this price range because you won't get any.. After a detailed research of 2 weeks I have bought it.,1
5,I m writing my opinions after using the phone approx. 3 months..First of all the design is more than awesome which is make it a perfect looking phone.. Camera quality is very good.. Fast finger print scanner... Face recognition is also a good feature of this phone means it is quite fast.. There r a lot of other features which are a reason to buy this product in this budget segment..,0
4,"Kirin 710 processor is good, we can play high end games without any lagging. Camera is excellent, but the image gets little saturated (slight variation in actual color and image color)Sound quality and volume is little lessBattery backup is little less, also there is no fast charging. It requires about 2 hours to charge from 5% to 100%.Mobile gets little heated while charging and also while playing high end games.Overall satisfied.",0
4,"Going to the pros: Display quality, Battery life, Glass finish design, Camera quality with AI features which was enhanced by HOTA update, highly responsive fingerprint sensor and a loads of various EMUI features that come in handy in day to day use.Cons: The chipset even with tha 6GB RAM feels a bit underperformer, charging time could have been faster and Google security patch updates as well as EMUI updates take time to reach the device.",0

Its full screen display is fantastic and look pleasant.📷 Camera quality is good. 🔊 I felt the sound to be low sometimes, but not bad.🔋 Battery is too good. You can easily go two days of usage without charging (for average user). For Heavy users it can solidly go for a complete day& more. Build quality is really great at this price. It looks premium.",0
5,Good phone. Build quality is good. Looks are also good. Lacks gorilla glass. Speaker quality not too great. Camera is good for instagram users who use lot of filters. Images have a yellowish tint in it. Doesn't look natural.When the phone was delivered I had a bump on the screen guard because of a grain between the screen and the guard. I removed the guard and Now the screen guard is not available in the local market.,0

5,Yes the picture quality is top class. The output of sound from the speakers is average I would say because you cant hear the sound when you're outdoors. I think the battery lasted for a day after full charge. No cons because everything works fine at this price point. Just go for it if you have a budget of 15K.PUBG is savage in game suit mode.,0
4,At the rate of 15 k and I'm buying in 10%instant cash back offer I got it 13.5 k nice to use... Sound quality also mind blowing.. Specially notch screen is superb.. Battery life also good I charged one time battery goes till 35 hrs using my mobile data and navigation on... Little disappointed with face unlock it's take time to unlock overall nice phone and must buy,0
4,"The smartphone is very good in picture quality, but enhanced the quality of sound. Battery is very power efficient with 12nm processor. I feel some dissatisfaction in rear camera photos are very saturated with AI also does not support 4k video recording and EIS. It is very much expected to provide fast charging service. One thing is very good it provide chip on film technology which facilitate bezel less phone.",0
5,The looks are really awesome..u can't find a better build quality in this price range...display is significant.. with 6 gb ram variant..it is so smooth... the bettery life is quite good enough for a regular user....camera is pretty impressive except the low light mode...and sound is pretty descent ...overall this product is worth the price and can easily challenge the Xiaomi products.I recommend to go for this product ♥️,1
5,"Fingerprint reader is fabulous... Fantastic phone to use... Battery life is too good... After a level of good use, it gives approx 18-22 hrs of backup... Otherwise you can use it for almost 2 days in standby... I use this phone in gesture mode.. And it is too good... Very time the sensor works properly... Face unlock is also awesome... Overall very good phone.. In budget..",0
4,Using the phone from past 2months. For day to day usage very good. Pubg too runs well without any major lag. It is good for the price. The only gripe is that there is no 4k recording and there's no any video stabilisation.The battery backup is ok. It'll get you through 8hours to 9hours from full charge with average use.,0
4,Great performance...Overall the phone is very good in this range.. Camera would have been a bit better and fast charging would have given an advantage...Great for playing games,0
5,Excellent phone for its price range.As far as I know it is the only phone that offers 6 GB RAM in this price.The build quality is very good and the phone looks and feels premium to handle and use.,0

4,Like :-Battery life is too good.Displays is also good as I expected.Camera is superb you can check samples.Dislike :-When I playing PUBG or asphalt 9 heat too much not for lover game lovers.Not fast charging full display mode is not availableNo 1080 video recording,0
5,It's an amazing phone. Camera quality is awesome. Great battery life. Looks premium. Just 2 problem sound is less and it is slippery so better have a back cover which is already given.Internet speed is great and better connectivity.Just buy this phone. Amazing experience.,0
5,Incredible phone from Honor. There's nothing to say as a major “con” according to me. Everything's perfect if you're a light smartphone user who just need all the specs at an affordable price segment. If your budget is around Rs 15k go for it. Ignore phones like Mi A2 that only has good camera and doesn't even retain headphone jack and has uninspiring battery life and dim display as it's cons.,1
4,Product is awesome and feel premium in this budget killer performance and good battery backup but one thing is not good that in slow motion Pic its just getting small multiple dots on screen. Worst slow motion Pic I have seen. Other is good,0

4,Well i was a bit skeptical when buying this phone. But it completely exceeded my expectations.The battery life is great. I've used the phone thoroughly for 2 days without charging.

5,I will break it into pros and cons:Starting with pros:Bigger and better display. Best in the price segmentFace unlock and fingerprint is ver responsive and fast.The all new kirin 710 makes it smooth like butterBack camera is awesomeBattery is 3750 but still due to emui aggressive ram management works like 4000 mah.This small notch like one plus 6 is quite pleasing unlike poco f1.Gpu turbo support for higher frame rates and low power consumption.Dedicated npu for the ai support.The buit quality is awesome that u can't get in this price segment as soon as you will hold the phone you will feel the differenceNow cons:Front camera is not as good as expected out of 16 mp.Although it has gpu turbo. Still the mali gpu g-51 is significantly less powerful than is competitor adreno 512 in real me 2pro.(well if you ask me i think gpu turbo is a bit of marketing gimic).No heating issues but with intense pubg your device will get warm.No gorilla glass.VERDICT :totally go for it you can't get a better built quality and better looking phone at this price segment with great back camera and awesome processor.,1

5,"It is an outstanding phone! The battery goes for 2 days for me and thanks to the super charger, it hatsly takes 40 minutes to reach full charge. Camera is incredible and the phone looks so premium. It actually the fastest phone in the world as of now (feb2019). The phone is super snappy and nothing slows it down. Highly highly recommended!",0
5,"Most of the features are very good, especially the camera. To make things clear I'll put down the pros and cons.Coming to pros1. Very good Camera hardware (The best combinations of 3 cameras)2. Battery life3. Display4. Kirin 980 provides a very smooth experience5. 40 watts fast charger6. Face ID works very fine7. Call reception and call quality8. Unique designCons1. Front camera2. No headphone jack (Important for audiophiles)3. The in-display fingerprint scanner is slow (hoping that it will be improved with updates)From the above, we can say cons are not a big deal. The pros make it one the best smartphone available right now.Overall, you will get more than what you pay for.",1
1,"I got a replacement after having battery issues with the first phone I received. The phone as such is great, but having severe signal issues... Calls take atleast 10 - 30 seconds to connect and it gets irritating after a point in time. Also the opposite party can hardly hear what I speak and I have to keep calling them repeadly.",0
3,Camera is not upto the mark. Camera shots not producing a natural image like that of Apple. UI a major draw back for a phone of this value. Battery seems ok. Processing speed is good.,0
5,"After the latest updated (9.0.0.183) this phone has become a super-phone!Fantastic as my daily driver for battery life, charging speed, camera, in call sound quality and build quality. Now only if they did something about the restrictive features of EMUI - does not unleash the full potential of ANdroid PIe.",0
5,"I was using Mate 9 before this. That was a market leading technology phone in 2017. I was very happy with the Mate series of Huawei brand. Had an opportunity to buy this Mate series in India  this time through Amazon was quite welcoming. As far my experience with this Mate 20 pro was very satisfying, as it delivered the result as it was marketed.. Looking forward more from this manufacturer in the future for their best in class technology.",1
5,"Battery Life is sick and i luv it. Front Camera not upto expectation but rear one is good though. Jumped into the swimming pool, still working so ip68.... Hence Proved. Speakers are moderate, but the headphones provided are beautifull",0
5,Fantastic battery life and super fast chargingFace recognition is annoying failed almost 50°/• of timesCamera no complaints quite awesome macro shots,0
5,"Amazing phone. Though there is a WiFi issue in these models based on your router configuration. Took me a day to sort it out, but now works flawlessly.",0
5,Got with Sennheiser pxc 550 offer ....this is awesome ...can't believe this phone is freaking awesome 🤩,0
5,Rear camera is awesome.... Macro shots superb. Selfie camera not so sharp. Night mode stunning. Battery superb.... Superfast charging.,0
5,"Great Device as described..... Great Camera, Awesome charging speed, Lightning fast face ID and In Display Fingerprint Scanner, Best Display, Top quality Build..... Just Go for it",1
5,I received the phone about 15 hours back. Everything about this phone seems to be in line with the glowing reviews you bump into everywhere. The only lag that the Kirin 980 processor could not handle was the little delay in its delivery!,0
1,"the performance is slick and as good as any top flagship like Note 9.AI has lots of issues, its jst for the sake of sayin they have put this feature.Charges preety quickly. in 45 minutes nearly 90%. The camera is good and few features are impressive however overall it could have been kept in the range of 30 to 38k. i dont see any worth and Note9 would have been a far superior buy..",1
2,"Firstly I bought a Mate 20 pro, after unboxing to my shock , I noticed there was a minute abrasion stretching in the centre. Though it  was no easily noticeable , it could be fairly seen in broad day light and in well lit room. So I was not satisfied to own a piece which came as defective. Then I claimed for a replacement . Honestly the service was very instant and applaudable. The piece was inspected by a person , and he identifed the abrasion and updated the piece to be defective. In couple of days the new one arrived, in immediate exchange of the first one. I was greatly happy and relived. But that isn’t all. When I opened the next one , to my disappointment this piece to had a abrasion right at the centre of the screen , though not as big as the first one , yet noticeable. Now that I am really fed up and tired of initiating complaints any further . I just thought of using the same . So I remind others , if you are really planning to buy one , think twice and make sure when you unbox there isn’t any abrasion on the screen",1
4,I liked the phone very much but giving 4 stars due to a few issues.Fingerprint sensor does not work all the time.Notch is bigSelfie camera is not upto the mark in this price range.See a little green screen on the sidesNotifications are not shown in the locked screen,0
3,"The very first thing i have noticed is that, Huawei launched mate 20 pro for Rs 69000 officialy, but on amazon the shows 79000 and put discount as 10k why? is the amazon is fooling us?From i started using Huawei p10 for the last 2 year, im become a fan of HuaweiThen i decided to buy mate 20 pro, After the  5 days of waiting  me received mate 20 proThe twilight colour looks sok, but very slippy on hands (the emerald green, blue  and the black are not avilable in india very disappointing, )During my usage sometimes it got stacked (never had an experiance on p10 during the last 2 years)On screen finger print scanner not working properleyBattery backup is almost 10hrs for a long usageCamera is pretty good and im attached 3 images with 3 different shooting mode speakers are goodHuawei not selling the original cases vey very disappointingOverall  Huawei done a nice job",0
5,"Excellent battery life and charging speedPhone is fast, display of also very nice. The only negatives are that the dual speakers are of very good quality but are just not loud enoughAnd the wireless charger offer wasn't available for the first customers 😑And no colour choices",0
5,"Beautiful phone just love the feel of it, the camera is so good I had to take like 80 pics at a marriage function as everyone love the pics coming out of the camera :) worth the buy + the free headphones is icing on the cake",0
5,Awesome camera awesome build quality and color options huawei beat all brands in comming days,1
5,This phone is the best currently for its camera capabilities.If one wants DSLR like quality in their pocket this is the phone to have.,1
5,Extremely fast phone with outstanding camera. Battery is good enough of 36 hrs on normal usage. Very happy with it. Kirin 980 processors doesn't let any,0
3,Videos tend to become wavey. That's disturbing. Aps become suddenly slow,0
5,I ordered this phone as soon as it available for sale and it didn't disappoint me at all.just one word i had to say all flagship smartphones out there-R.I.P.There is no doubt that this beast is the king of smartphones,1
5,This is my first Android phone and money well spent!! Camera is absolutely stunning and phone is a beast!!,0
5,"Overall performance, battery, camera is good. Loads of options are available but there some issues with the animation gestures which are probably maybe rectified in future update... Check for gluegate issue when u got the phone.",0
5,"One of the best phones I have ever used. Do something,..rob banks, take loans or sell your kidney but make sure you buy this phone. Its worth every penny.",1
5,"It is excellent rounded off phone with very good camera, long battery back up refined UI and nice hardware. Overall it is all packed smartphone.",0

4,Amazing Battery.Seamless performance.Crystal clear HDR display experience.Fast charging at its best.,1

5,"The best alrounder phone.... Buttery smooth touch like I phone xs Max... Display is really praiseworthy... Very color accurate... But, in display fingerprint is rather hit or miss sometimes.... Fully satisfied with its outstanding performance and it is worth it...",1
5,No doubt that this is the Giant in any aspect of mobile functions. Battery superb+ Charging Superb + Camera Superb + Display superb + Easy to use with single hand. Thanks Amazon for one day delivery & Huawei for this masterpiece.,0
5,It was a Steal Deal with Sennheiser PXC550 Wireless Headphones. Just loved both the beasts. Glad to say that Huwaei really destroyed one Apple fan.Guys just go for it and thanks Amazon and Green Mobiles for such a delightful experience 👍,1
5,Wow........ Get ur hands on one to experience the sleekiness of this beast yet baby..... The face unlock works like a charm........amazing EVERYTHING......... SENNHEISER PXC 550 bundled is  unbelivable........ Woww,0

1,"Got bad and defective price twice , still having problem with EMI purchase refund.Mobile is awesome. One of the best mobile in terms of screen resolution",1
5,This device is as beautiful as it gets. Very sleek and fits easily in the hand. Great vibrant colours. Speakers aren't the best but not bad either. Flagship in true sense,1
5,"Excellent product. Everything about this phone is excellent. Design, cameras, screen quality, texture, premium build. But, If only speakers could be a bit louder...!!",0
1,"Wrost Camara ever Seen, There is a free wireless charger but I did not received, wrost mobile ever seen by me.",0
5,The phone is really amazing especially its battery life but the only problem here is the fingerprint scanner and the facial recognition which needs to be updated doesn't work properly,0
5,"Fantastic phone truely a beast, mythological kraken. Lot of first in segment features. The EMUI OS will improve further with updates. Huawei has done very well with this mobile.",0
5,It's an amazing Phone.. I upgraded it from OnePlus 6 and was amazed by it's powerful camera features... I am absolutely awestruck by it's performance in day to day life...,0
4,"This is a beast when comes to performance, battery and rear camera. The only one thing which i don't liked is the front camera(Give us the option to disable beautification mode).",0
5,Like everything except front camera performance. Also haven't received any updates since purchase. It is still on version 9.0.0.113 whereas latest is 9.0.0.142,0
5,Fantastic phone superb look grip and screen battery gaming every thing fantastic but having some bugs in the software ui it will be corrected with a update hope so,0
5,"I've used enough android phones over the last 10 years but can safely tell you this ones the best. Battery, camera, processor, speed resolution, everything takes the cake.",1
4,No search bar in call. Logs. To switch on other sim icon not there. No update come fast. Switichng from one sim to another should be on desk ન fast.,0
5,Super mobile till date by huawei to notch product the best thing is its camera and battery back up super I am loving it,1
5,"Battery life, lowlight, face recognition and totally phone is awesome and I'm a person who search for uniqueness from other common brands",0
5,"The phone is freaking good and the screen is outstandingly sharp. No complains on the performance and people who follow technology know that as of 2018 December this is easily the most powerful phone in the world. However it is not all cherry blossom ! I've few issues.1. Emui doesn't allow to set the default launcher to anything else except Huawei s own launcher. I'm fine with it as Huawei gave definitely toned down the heavy UI. One who wants to customise their phone with Nova launcher or any other launcher should be aware of this.2. The rear camera is awesome and gives amazing results given you switch off the AI mode. But it is the front facing camera that is the problem. Without it is very high megapixel front facing camera, the extremely heavy smoothening is a problem. You can see the difference when you click a picture from a different app and see for yourself.Highlight of the phone is the battery and the time it takes to charge it. It's just body brilliant. It just took me to 1 hour 6 minutes to charge this mammoth battery from 0 to 100 %.All in all amazing phone if you can live with the Huawei launcher. Worth the buy! Won't regret the purchase 😊",0
2,Guyz check this in your phone also turn the display on grey colour and check whether the green screen issue appears are not.. Worst experience. Applied for replacement I don't know whether they will give new device or swap with other replaced mobile. Hoping good,0
5,"70k can buyTV(mi tv 24k),Fridge(10k),Washing machine(10k),Microwave(15k),Fast Smartphone Mobile(Xiaomi latest model 11k)OrThis mobile , which will be outdated in 1 year at maxCoz technology is changing so fast.Due to the fact these companies brain washed us, spending 70k on mobile feels normal to many but same people will hesitate to buy a fridge etc important appliance for home and most of these people will never feed a hungry poor person.",0
5,If you need a 📷 phone then this is the best pick.If you need a gaming phone then this is the best pick.If you need a daily driver then this is the best pick.Conclusion- best pick! 😅,1
5,"I got this phone from Croma Store Bengaluru, as it wasn't available online at that moment. I can say this is the best flagship phone one can buy at the moment. It has a great battery life and extremely fast charging.AWESOME CAMERA: From wide angle to 5x hybrid zoom everything is pretty awesome.What I don't like is the front camera, as its no where a 24MP camera, photos are decent but has kind of smooth finish.Phone is buttery smooth, can handle any game thrown at it.Face recognition is best in class with a pretty quick finger print scanner as well.I was planning to buy a Pixel 3 from February then changed the thought and thought of 6T but ended up on this beauty piece of Hardware.The EMUI 9 is also very good when it comes to customization.Just brought up the major things I like and dislike about it. Rest there are still a lot of features to talk about but let's end it up now 😁",1
5,"After using it 4 months now, I can say it is best in all premium phone.PROS- Battery Life is superb and super charger refilled power in 20 mins- Processor Kirin is mindblowing , no lagging during highend games.- Camera captures beautiful scenic pics . In low light pictures are superb and only Pixel can match with this.- Face recognisation is good- Beautiful.design and super OLED screen quite vibrant in colour saturationsCons- Finger print scanner need improvemt and can be improved in next software update- Pricing a bit higher side.Overall my opinion , Go for this and you'll not regret .",1
5,Simply extraordinary in all aspects. Believe I bought note 9 instead this masterpiece obviously I sold my note 9 due to lack of speed and this kirin is really unbelievable and a tough competitor for snapdragon almost both are equal. And the design is exceptional one. But the price is a bit higher.,1
5,"I like it's all the features but camera department is just killer who needs dslr when I have a Huawei mate 20 pro it's battery is impressive, display is quite sharp and vibrant  in display Fingerprint sensor is lighting fast. In last I would say not thinking about it just buy it😍",0
5,"Great product at such cheap price. I only have to sell my one kidney to buy this phone. For more better experience I would suggest you to buy headphone also which is also very affordable. I only have to pay rs 99,999  only to buy the combo. It's a NOW OR NEVER DEAL",1
4,This phone is the best i like everything but i am fed-up with software part everyone is getting regular update and we are stucked will 126 version update if huawei is not able to give support then why they launched in India. Ultimately we use software and with glitches hardware doesn't work properly. Please huawei do some thing,1
5,Loved the phone. It has a monster battery and outstanding camera and top notch screen. Loved it and highly recommended.,0

5,"I had been waiting to review this since a few days but it wouldn't let me do it. Although my package got delayed a bit, is still super happy to have received it. I unboxed it immediately and it was right there. The box came with the 40watt super wall charger with a USB type c cable. Of course I would've loved to see a wireless charger included as well. There's a pair of type c earphones that are good to. There's a type c to headphones jack adapter cable included as well. A sim card removal tool, a clear soft plastic back cover, the phone itself and some paperwork in the box. I powered it on and it was very easy to setup this phone. I have been using an android phone previously. They pre provided a phone clone app that let me move all my data from the previous phone to the new phone in about 50 minutes (78gb). So that was really quick. The charger definitely charges the phone to a full battery in about 40 minutes. Display is great, I'm glad I got a BOE display and have no #Gluegate issue. Cameras work as described. Still testing them out however. Minimal bloatware apps thankfully. Was able to remove all. Battery is lasting over a day of intense usage. No other issues reported so far in 4 days of usage.",0

1,"Today just one month passed to use this mobile, A pink line mark come on screen, may be it is defective part given by Huawei. Tottaly unsatisfy, after a big deal, a big loss too",0
4,Capable of doing anything which other flashing can do and battery life no one can match this inam sure. I am a very heavy user and for me it stay for 1 day with full net uses and 1.5 day with moderate uses. Only thing i don't like is user interface. It should be stock android.,0
5,"Huawei have done pretty amazing job with this phone. This is an absolute beast with so many features. Premium feel, great looks, really cool camera and so many good features.Only thing which is not convincing is the reverse wireless charging which is a gimmick. Overall this is a great phone with great features.",0
5,"The best phone you can get right now in 2018.Super performanceSuper displaySuper battery life(it's 2.5 days since charged , still got 30% juice )Super camera",1
5,Best smartphone and value for money.Front camera is not great and stereo speakers are good but less than S9 plus.,1
5,Upgrade from p20 Pro. The problem is the fingerprint scanner. Doesn't pick fingerprint... Let's wait for the update,0

Dont like very small notification icon.No battery % display in notifications bar.I purchased on 3rd December with great launch offer. Huawei Amazon thanks.",0
1,Phone is very good but their monthly security updates are very slow in India. Again i am repeating the same as of May 19 i am still with 01 March 2019 update.  Please take  this into account before buying any Huawei flagships.,0
5,"Loving the phone but only concern is the green light visible in low light on the screen edges. Camera is just fantastic, especially Night shot.Note: Got a BOE unit instead of LG display but still see the greenish tint. Hopefully it doesn't increase as I keep using the phone.",0
3,"Very good & beautiful phone but bad network reception, probably weak modem. Returned it. Had same issues with P20 pro which I noticed after the return window was over",0
5,Phone is good...Photos came out great even during night..felt same as s9 minus the weight..Finger Scanner works great..,1
5,Amazing phone super fast....battery life is easyily more than 2 days...camera is superb...screen is very clear and vibrantI used to use note 9 as my primary camera but now mate 20 pro is my primary camera to shoot for my blog and Instagram...Ir blaster is soo handy and has saved me many times ..well done Huawei will wait for mate 30 pro,0
5,"Got Huawei P30 Pro aurora 8GB/256GB yesterday with GT sport watch.The phone- It is beyond camera.Zoom ultimate, as good as you got hold of moon. Super night photography the sky comes on ground with normal stable hand stars gets captured in your phone. Performance unmatched, speed excellent super fast, battery powerful. In totality this is the world's best and top most mobile ever launched and used. 100 out of 100. Rest you need to try on your own for sure!",1
5,Best camera phone in the market. Low light photography is magic. So is zoom on a phone.Design of the phone is top notch.Feels and looks like a flagship.Battery is amazing. Lasts two days on normal usage.Cons: edge display makes accidental touches. EMUI is not as good as stock Android.,1
5,"Product arrived as promised one next to next day of ordering.On opening the box, seriously I was stunned.It took some time to get knack of it. But once I used it, I loved the emui.Design is superb,Display is awesome,Feel is premiumIt's not slippery, though use the case provided.Battery backup is great.Camera is all rounder. Sample shots attachedCharging is crazy fast.No lag issues.And the more you use it, more you gonna love it.",0
2,"Fhd display is a big letdown not flagship standard....low light capabilities with night mode on is excellent as well as zoom other than that nothing,images are terribly over sharpened and video recording is awful with frequent frame drops and stutters ....emui is terrible,poor display",0
4,Phone is awesome. Excellent camera and stunning low light photography. Battery life is very good.Only thing which is not good is that huawei does not release software updates here in India on time. Huawei doesn't give importance to this region.,0
5,"This is an excellent phone. Camera is beyond imagination. Low light photographs are too impressive. Ultra Zoom is a big addion. The plus points are all over the internet.What I didn't like :1. Little bulky/heavy although its just a matter of few days then you wont even notice the extra few gms in your hands.2. No double tap to wake up or sleep.3. Rounded edges pick the false touches, a decent case might solve this.4. Screen Resolution is low but, again, with little tweaks it can be taken care of.5. No 3.5mm head phone jack.6. The SOFTWARE....the biggest let down for me...7. The always ON display cant be customized.8. The usual Huawei bloatwares!!",0
5,"I would just say WOW!The phone is as like as I expected.The screen, camera, wide angle, low light and the main thing 50x zoom amazing.The battery life lasts for tow days on average use with 4g.The super charger with 40w charges 50%in just 18min. That's an advantage for the busy person.The stereo speaker are good.The company gave apple type headphonesounds great.No headphone jack and no extinction cord in the box.Over all the phone worth it.",0
5,The Best Camera Phone I had used till date. And special mention for the battery life and the look of the phone.,1
5,Amazing camera and great specification... happy to switch from oneplus 5t to p30 pro.. 50x zoom is boom,0
5,This phone is monster... I really happy to have it.. Camera is never seen before... Battery life is very good with supercharging 70% in 30 minute...,0
5,Unlock process not good while I am using thumb lock its asking swiping also. So if I use thumb unlock directly will be good,0
5,Excellent phone and I am so happy with it and I switched from I phone and was waiting for sometime to fine the right one. If you do not need such an advance camera you can buy one plus 6t at much low price. The problem was they said buy the watch at 2000 but billed for 15000 and made some confusion. Do not buy on no cost EMI and this is also a problem. After claiming no cost they are charging interest and you will pay 4000 more. They are confusing and trying to fool you with EMI option,1
1,"It's not even a month I bought the phone and now my phone microphone is not working I have to use headphone or keep the phone to loudspeakers to speak to other person.And there is no proper service center of huawei at my state (sikkim) and I don't know what shall i do, such a costly khone and this problem aroused.Please help to solve my problem, what shall I do.",0
5,"Excellent camera, unbelievable zoom,  low light king it can see things you won't see with your eyes. Please see the sky photo attached , took it pointing to the complete dark sky .If you have a steady hand it will give noiseless quality photo even at complete darknessI was a OnePlus 6t user and I am really missing that smooth UI and performance,if it has1.stock android UI,2. Better video recording it will be best smartphone in the world",1
2,Face unlocking is not working in darkness not even in low light areas very very disappointed too much expensive phone and such a big issue,0

1,"Google reportedly ends business with Huawei. Outside china, you cannot access google proprietary apps like play store, gmail, youtube, chrome, photos, drive....you will not get any kind of Android updates, not even small security patches. Imangine buying this phone of 71k with no access to google apps and OS updates.Please google about this news. RIP Huawei outside china.",0
5,"It took me 2 Days to decide whether to buy this or not. My first experience with Huawei.Phone feels great, camera is outstanding, and so is the battery. The UI could need some work but still is clean.Better value than buying an S10+ or XS",1
5,The best camera phone ever. The camera is just dumb founding. It's magnificent. You will be amazed at the quality of photographs even in pitch dark. 10x zoom with background blurring in videos are probably features that are seen for the first time on a smartphone. Screen is very good and so is the battery life. Must buy.,1
5,"I have used last one month then i fell it's a all-rounder phone.So, i suggest to u if your budget no matter then u definitely buy this phone.",0
5,"Excellent pH in world.... Salute for huawei company... Better camera,battery is amazing and pH is sexy look touch feeling too good, plz buy this pH, watch also too good, speed is amazing ❤️❤️❤️",0
4,Awesome product... Has great battery life. On medium ussage with a single sim. It's easily giving a battery backup of whopping 26 plus hours.Camera quality is amazing... I.e night mode. Ai mode . Macro mode everything is good. Though it has 50 X zoom. However post 10 X image quality is quite compromised..Screen quality is again good. Considering the fact it's fhd+ display yet it's beautiful... Only downside is that I am not able to find a tempered glass...Inscreen earpiece is awesome... Voice is crystal clear,0
5,"Till now happy with the features of the phone no issues , not tried wireless charging, hope it shall be a worth buy",0
5,"Mind blowing camera. Please don't compare this with s10+. This phone kicks the competition away in all the aspects like camera, battery, screen, quick charge, etc...",1
4,Just went GaGa over the photos it takes; Mediocre finger print reader and face recognition function..Putting all that aside very happy with the machine as it fulfills my need for a camera phone.,0
5,"If you like DSLR like photos with your phone, without the hassle of carrying a DSLR and image processing, this is the phone to buy.",0
5,The product is great except one near-fatal flaw. The screen is not gorilla glass and easily getting scratched. The product is high end and I don't know why Huawei decide to cut costs in the screen protection part.,0
5,Very good looking with a battery that makes me snigger at people holding a phone along with a mobile charger. Zoom capability tests my ability to keep my hands steady.,0
5,"Every aspect of this phone is unrivaled and unmatched.... Word's can't do justice in describing... Have it, feel it, experience it, you will be speechless..",0
4,"It's an amazing piece, the best mobiles ever owned, camera is also amazing, gud battery backup and fast charging comes in very handy when running out of time",1
5,"Great phone with the Greatest camera till date on phone. Delivers on all promises, battery, UI, display, speed, everything. If you like to shoot this is for you.",0
3,"Just be cautious:Google has revoked android license from Huawei. The result is Huawei won't be able to use any Google services like Google playstore , Gmail, YouTube etc. henceforth. Also existing as well as future Huawei smartphones will not get future Android versions and Google services. This is no joke.",0
1,Youtuber recently exposed that p30 pro taking moon photos is fake it actually download a similar image like your moon one and mixes it,0
5,"US government has made Google to halt its services  to Huawei. Also now, they cannot use any other hardware or software from US.Its a great phoneRIP huawei.",0
5,"Its awesome mobile, camera is best seen till date, low light photos or i will say no light photos are also captured beautifully,point it towards sky and it captures stars also perfectly, macro photos are like u carry a micrscope, 50x zoom is 😍, performance is also top notch,gaming is butter smooth with high graphix setting, fingerprint reader is much faster than s10 also coz i have both, it charges in no time with 40w charger.",1
5,Actually P series for serious photography...Used P20 Pro... It was also a killer flagship.About p30 pro... Can't digest to say... Just go for it if you really want a mobile dslr.....Everything is just perfectly embedded and perfect integration with leica....You get 8gb 256gb which freeze your device for smooth mode.Zoom works perfectly.... Object where our eyes can't see... P30 pro captures.Battery as usual Huawei delivers a promosing one.Low light no other phone can match at present.Attached zoom photos... Original one no editing,1
3,"After using somedays.Pros.1.A perfect compact size.2.Bigger battery.4.Best Camera undoubtedly.Cons.1.EMUI2. LACKS OF STEREO SPEAKER.3. VOICE BLEEDING. (If you are talking on phone in silent place or in a room, the person sitting besides you can hear easily what other side person is saying. Why company put earpiece in screen I can't understand.)4. DISPLAY. (Don't take me wrong, it has good display but not the best as you are paying 72k bucks. Company must improve it.",1
5,"Great battery and display, excellent cameras. Would rate 4.5 for the slightly weaker WiFi reception and for the not so great UI and speaker audio quality. Though network reception is great. Had network problems with the P 20 pro and mate 20 pro which had to be returned /disposed but happy that such problems have been resolved with the P30 pro. Overall great phone especially for photos and the marathon battery. Amazon delivery was amazing as usual, great customer support",1
5,"Very good product. But recent ban on this product in USA regarding technical issues, company has to assure its customers in future issues",0
5,It is a very good phone. But future updates are uncertain as reports comes in that google is restricting Huawei from using android in future phones. Seems like the existing phones are fine though. Pity as it is such a good phone with a superb camera.,0
5,"What a beauty...I am satisfied. Thank you Huawei India. Gorgeous look. Beautiful display and most of amazing set of cameras. Great battery life, network reception, touch response. Sound good not great. Superb fast charging. Selfie or portrait shots good but not as good as Google pixel. Overall I am satisfied. Upto 5x zoom amazing. Need more time to explore. Will update later....",0
5,"I ended up buying 3 of these - one for me and the other two for my sons for Christmas. Reason I got one myself was that I couldn't believe the price so opened mine before the Amazon 30 day return (before Christmas)... Personally I moved from being a life long Samsung owner but now this kit has literally blown the Samsung's out of the water for functionality and value. The OS is so simple to use and not bloated with non-useable apps etc. So speedy and so far exceptionally reliable. Not a single issue - Turned it on, transferred from my old Android and then it did a system update. Battery life is brilliant - charge every couple of days if that.. I was so impressed with Huawei that I went and bought the Huawei watch 2 (got it yesterday in an Amazon deal so still playing).. Would recommend Huawei if looking for great value and high specs. I'm converted ! P.s. Kids are blow away with the phones too - which is really who they were bought for.",0
5,"Brilliant phone, does everything I need. Dual SIMs is fantastic for not carrying a personal and work phone. Camera is brilliant. Performance of the phone is excellent.",0
5,"Everything about the phone is amazing, it's very fast and the camera is fantastic. The battery will last for two full days without a problem.",0
5,"Good piece of gear, amazing camera, great battery that charges fast as well.Only minus is the home button is right under the space bar, so you have to be careful when you type or you end up on the home page.",0
1,mine develop a ticking noise from the loudspeaker after one week . it' s basically  based on  the older Samsung phone . very disappointed.,0
5,"This phone is amazing. I suggest you get a really good case because if you drop in, replacement screens might damage the battery .",0
5,"Great camera esp night vision, fast, good reception, screenshot pages at a go, dual Sim for travelling. Expensive though.",0
5,"I love this phone. Have had a Huwawei phone before and find the interface easy to use and intuitive. This is no exception. Superfast, sharp images, wonderful camera and beautiful to hold. It's a thing of beauty and I hope to keep it for a long time.",0
4,"I didn't like the quality of the sound when talking (phone/Whatsapp/Skype). You feel the phone shaking in your hands and sound is not totally clear. Sometimes it's difficult to hear what the person is saying (both ways).Another thing I didn't like: in my previous Android phone, I had an icon that showed all the installed applications and this feature is not available in P20 Pro.Regardless of these 2 things, the phone is really great, specially the camera.",0
5,"Really happy with my purchase, great price for a brand new phone.Arrived quickly.Would definitely use again.",0
3,"Hi, I'm unhappy with this item. Within a month of careful use of the phone my fingerprint didn't work anymore. It freezez most of the time also. I can bearly use it. I don't recomend this product. Is this 100% genuine phone? I would like to have it replaced please. It is still within the phone warranty.",0
5,Camera is just awesome in low light. Split screen option is pretty cool...useful for side by side comparisons of products online.,0
5,"Very happy with the product. Bought as a gift for my dad., he loves it. He is using face recognition and the battery life is longer than other phones.",1
5,"Very pleased! Quick service, arrived before the allocated delivery date. The phone is beautiful and works great very easy to use. Best phone I had!",1
1,"This phone is full of software glitches - I got one because of the great camera & it immediately developed three serious faults in the first month and their customer services could not provide permanent fixes for them.1. the keypad gets disabled in-call, this means you cannot navigate automated phone systems. The suggested fix is to clear the cashe i.e. you need to clear the cashe before very single phone call! and it’s not that easy you need to reboot holding two buttons down and 4 out of 5 times it just reboots normally EVENTUALLY (after a lot of repeats)  it reboots with an option the clear the cashe2. the phone usess mobile data even when this function is turned off and even when wifi is available – I have screen grabs showing the mobile data is ‘off’ but showing it still using mobile data…. This ran up a massive bill in the first month3. the battery saver turns the apps off without warning you that its done this or asking permission – I use recording app to record meetings and selected phone calls for the purpose of taking precise and detailed notes afterwards. This phone keeps turning it off and literally costs me thousands of pounds in missed information. I managed to eventually set the battery saver so it did not block this recording app (I think) but it was palaverFinally, it came loaded with a massive amount of unwanted apps that took ages to get rid ofI had to insist on a change of handset in the end as I was living in fear of some new disastrous glitch causing me more disasters – this not something I do lightly as by then literally all my stuff was on the phone and he last thing I wanted to do was start overCompletely rubbish",0
4,"Amazing camera, battery life and speed. BUT recent update tries to force you to use their version of Google assistant. I get regular pop ups relating to it and have to dismiss, often when I try to take a picture too and this makes me miss the moment.",0
5,After reviewing and procrastination to death I went for the p20 Pro based on reviewing reviews for hours... Not disappointed! Number 1 reason I chose this device was the camera and it's surpassed expectations it's truly exceptional!.Prossesor speed... InstantaneousMemory... More than I'll needScreen... Crystal clearEase of use... Like most android devices... Idiot proofExtras... Lots of in built-in pleasing little functionsI'll not bother with size weight and all that rubbish.. You won't limp and it fits in pocketsHighly recommended from humble moi,0
5,Been using Huawei for past 3 years. Their phones are really good build. The OS was taking up around 4GB space so have upgraded to P20 Pro.,0
5,"Model: P20 lite 64gb dual SIMSeller: Amazon Warehouse DealThe bad: paid for Amazon next day on a Wednesday, arrived on a Sunday! Work that out... Apparently it's next day from when THEY decide to dispatch!Anyway, the rating is about the phone.I tried a Moto G6 Play and the phone was poor quality on calls, signal and lack of NFC on the dual SIM version, so I returned to Amazon and added some extra money to get a P20 lite... Boy was it worth it.I can honestly say it's the best phone I've ever had, thin, classy, quick & top notch! Its certainly the real deal!Battery lasts a full day nearly 2, at the moment I have 50% left at 10:50pm and it's been unplugged since 7:30am using dual sim, WiFi, Bluetooth, nfc all on.The phone is responsive, quick, and crisp. Never had a Huawei before but I can highly recommend them.EMUI (their software) is very similar to stock android, I could hardly tell a difference.Only slight moan (if I was picky) is that the dual SIM function does allow you to manually set a contact to a SIM, but a free app from play store sorted that, problem over!It's light, it's, bright it's a delight! :)Do not hesitate to buy, I'm sure the P20 & P20 plus are quality... But LITtlE brother is the next best thing when on a budget and / or you want dual SIM.",1
1,"It says 'Duel Sim' in the title but this phone is actually a Single sim version.The sim slot showing 'Sim 1' on one side and 'NM' (nano memory i suppose) on the other side.I am not happy with this. Dual sim is one of the main reason i bought this phone, and now we had a false advertisement.The phone model i received is VOG-L09. I looked up on the internet that only VOG-L29 is the dual sim version.Cannot believe this could happen on Amazon and Huawei.Ridiculous.",0
5,Cracking phone at a great price . Love the phone clone feature which copies all apps and your old phone setup .,0
5,The dual dim version of this phone is a real bonus as it enables you to add a micro sd memory card. Very pleased with the phone and it was a smooth transfer over from my previous Samsung phone. I have only had it a week but impressed so far.,0
1,"after a few days using the phone, the colours and screen got completely unusable. I then returned it for a new one, but this time the sim slot wouldn't open. It is a shame, as it seemed like a good phone, but with the two I've tried I had a poor experience. I would not recommend it.",0
1,"Worst phone I've ever had! You buy cheap, you get cheap. Slow WiFi connection in the house after a while even though other devices are showing 70 Meg. This rubbish falters around 10, dropping to 5! Unable to find any online help. The Hisuite software for backup to pc doesn't work either.Do yourself a favour, save for a few more weeks and get a Samsung! That's what I'm doing. DO NOT BUY THIS RUBBISH!",0
4,"Great camera, great phone, but the version being sold on Amazon UK as Dual Sim is only a Single Sim version.",0
4,"I'm upgrading from a OnePlus 3 which I've had for nearly 3 years, and to be honest I didn't need to. It feels nice in the hand but with it being covered in glass, I bought a glass backed screen case and glass screen protector. It's very fast but barely noticeable over my old phone in normal operation. The oled screen is nice but I hate the curved edges, which I thought I'd like. A flat screen is far better to watch videos as it doesn't distort the picture and you get a lot of phantom touches with it having hardly any bezel. The camera is amazing, it's that good that my DSLR will be getting left home on holidays. I just wish the screen was flat.",0
5,I am sorry to say that but I am tight get for money. This the what I need from the smart phone. Finger print and stuff it is a perfect mobile phone. Be honest I haven't tried this p20 lite's camera yet. But it will be on YouTube very soon. Search for Teoman Ozsen on YouTube. Regards. ❤️,0
5,"Great phone. This was an upgrade from an old G4 phone. Really fast, great screen and camera. Lots of neat little features which makes it great to use particularly the swiping to make the screen small for single hand use whiles browsing. Battery charge time is fast and last long after charge.",0
3,"I bought this phone because of the good reviews about the camera on it, however I am disappointed when using the zoom as the picture sharpens too much and it appears to look like a filter has been added to it.  Picture quality is good with lots of camera features, as long as you don't use the zoom.  Phone unexpectedly rang a number from my contacts, while I was writing in a note app and I received a message telling me that l had a new voice message and when I listened to it it was actually an old message that I'd received and listened too three weeks earlier.Music player is good quality sound.  Phone looks good.  Battery life not to bad and charges really quickly.  I've always had Samsung phones and thought I'd give this one a try because of all the good reviews, but probably should have stayed with Samsung.",0
3,Dislike Huawei prohibit moving apps to SD card on their phones.Like the price only.Will buy Samsung next time.,0
5,"my son needed to replace his Samsung s5 and I have been looking at this phone, I took the gamble and my son absolutely loves it. he said its fast and really happy - so a reasonable phone on a sim only contract - hes happy and I am happy!!",0
5,"Love this phone! Prefer it to the Samsung I had previously. Took a few attempts to get the sim card tray out. Some sort of basic instruction leaflet would have been useful, but easy enough to work it out! All in all, a great phone with good battery life.",0
1,Well... Huawei 20 lite has a good camera but the battery life isn't good at all. Don't recomend  this phone. I have to charge twice a day. I want to save money buying a cheaper phone and I regret so much. I use Samsung for all my life and to be honesty they just don't have name they got quality. As huawei don't have. In the end I had to end up buying a power bank if I want to recharge the battery when I'm out. Even for free don't get this phone.,1
5,"This is a great phone. It handles the Wi-Fi very well. It takes two 'nano' sim cards to operate as a dual sim phone but these can be issued by your provider free of charge if you go to their shops (a Vodafone shop in my case). If the one of the second sims is from an overseas provider, you may have to go overseas and attend the shop there. An excellent phone though. Well worth it.",0
4,"This did not have the type of dual sim I was looking for.  Also, found the phone smaller than expected.  Long and narrow.  Changed for an Honor 8X which is larger and everything I wanted.",1
5,Brought this for my father. He loves it. Was a first time smart phone user. He picked up the functionality really quickly. Makes his life easier.,0
1,"It doesn’t have a keyboard so completely useless! Can’t message, google or sign into accounts. Shame, it would be the second huewei phone in the house, first one works fine.",0
4,"I brought this phone for my girlfriend, the first one we received stopped reading the SIM card but amazon quickly sent a replacement. The phone itself is fast, light and feels premium for the price, the camera is Stella as they always are with Huawei, I can't recommend this phone enough.",0
5,"Bought as a present.  I must say I'm really impressed with all the features from fingerprint recognition, battery life, storage ,quality of camera , high resolution screen to name but a few the list is endless. My 15 year old son absolutely loves his tech and to say he is pleased with this gift is an understatement.  I'm going to purchase 2 more for myself and hubby.",0
5,"Got this in the Amazon Warehouse deal for black Friday. Excellent value for money. Considering it is the light version we are still impressed with the speed, user interface and camera quality. Who needs to spends silly money on the Pro version, the price difference seriously can not be justified",0
1,"Constantly loses WiFi signal. Even tho can connect perfectly with a tablet, Amazon fire TV, laptop or even my old phone. Constantly have to switch WiFi/mobile data/airplane mode on and off to get it to work. Appalling customer service from Huawei. Full of bloatware that cannot be removed. Features that don't work such as inability to auto update apps. There is no way to use a memory card with this product. So don't think about ever wanting to get all of your information of the phone if there's ever a problem. £376 wasted on possibly the worst phone I've ever had. I can't afford to replace it so I'm stuck with this awful excuse for a phone. Avoid, stick to whatever else works for you. Not worth the hassle. P.s. I'm having to use my data to write this as the WiFi apparently has no internet (spoiler alert, the WiFi is working fine for every other device)",0
5,"Excellent phone, the ceamara is the best I have ever had on a phone. Internet is very quick and reliable. Sound and mic on calls is excellent. I have lost network a few times though it may just be my network..",1
5,What a magnificent phone fast charging wonderful sound quality magnificent picture quality really fast processor can't give this phone any higher grades would give it ten stars if I could buy with total confidence and you'll not regret buying a p20 lite huawei phone you'll wish you'd bought one years earlier believe me there just a real pleasure to use just can't believe how much I love it buy one no brainer and you too will have a magnificent phone,0
4,"I expected the battery to last longer than one day. Anyway, phone works fast, good looking, quality camera and cool features.",0
5,Bought to replace my wileyfox which conked out.Really love the Huawei screen and picture quality is fab. Camera is great too. Overall really pleased.Only downside is when I listen to music with headphones it's not as loud & bassy as my old phone but the sound quality is better.,1
2,"Bought this phone via Amazon, seller Uni-Zone. It arrived quickly. However, when I tried to charge it first time, after 15 minutes charger got really hot and it started smelling. It is original charger from the box. Scared to charge it again,  contacted seller yesterday, still waiting response. Phone is also downloading probably 5th system update in less than 24 hours. Don't know how good the phone is yet but need a new charger at least. It could be a hazard to use it again. You would expect a speedy response in this case",0
1,"I bought this because it was advertised as dual sim, it’s not. I see the description has now been changed and no mention of dual sim, too late! You’re getting it back!",0
5,"I already owned a Huawei phablet which was brilliant but quite large for a phone.  I wanted to a pocket size phone and bought the Huawei P20 lite.  The phone is so easy to use and offers a lot of the features which you would expect from one of the top brand phones but at a very reasonable price. I like the face recognition and fingerprint security.  It has so many features which I think other reviewers have already mentioned.  It is light and the screen is slightly larger than my previous phone.  The battery life could be longer, but I use mine quite a lot so it depends.  My partner was so impressed he also bought one.  My son who is a computer geek also bought a Huawei but the more expensive model.You won't be disappointed, this phone is excellent if you want  good quality, ease of use  and affordability.  Would definitely recommend.",0
1,"The phone isn’t as good for the price payed, also a promotion was stated before 4th April and they lied about it.",0
2,"I liked this phone and I wanted to keep it, but I soon discovered that there is a software bug that Huawei are aware of that affects the codec that Bluetooth audio is streamed with. Check online and you'll see what I mean. I returned this phone due to this manufacturers fault which was a shame as the screen was lovely and it otherwise looked well made.",0
3,Have had for less than four months and recently had issues that people can't hear me on phone and been crashing,0
4,Was planing to update my old phone and after some research this was the one i went for (politic not included) Nice and slim and android makes it easy to set up.  Good phone security (face/fingerprint and password ect) Was planing to get this through BT with an upgrade to my data but found it was cheaper to buy it out right than go for their plan.,0
5,"I had heard about the technology of Huawei  but the actual functioning of the phone is absolutely incredible. This is without  doubt the best phone I have ever had or ever hope to have. I have always railed against Chinese products believing they are undermining the whole infrastructure of the Western economy. Well that might be true but I don't care, this is an a absolute jewel. Beautiful screen, great camera, every convenient function one could hope for, too many to describe. But I should mention ease of connection to the internet and many websites of use.",1
3,Faulty sim draw. that just refuses to open took 30 mins to pry it free. Despite the spec my previous phone moto g5 was more reliable.... I find this phone behaves badly at times when even asking it to perform the simplest of tasks. Maybe I just got a dud? Oh and the Bluetooth sucks. Randomly disconnecting. Should of stuck with my Initial choice G6.,1
3,"This phone looked great, but the screen cracked on it after less than a week, and despite being in a case with a screen protector. That's never happened to me with any phone before ever. Huwai are offering free screen replacements for the first month of purchase to all users, so that suggests to me they are aware of the phones lack of structural integrity",1
5,"Had this phone a couple of weeks now.. Its very easy to use, ive had no issues, really happy. I didn't realise before I bought it that's its not compatible with my Fitbit... But not all is lost, if anyone has the same problems syncing up, there is an app called Sync fix for Fitbit... It says you have to pay after 10 days if it works, but I haven't had no reminders yet after 2 weeks, and It's syncing up fine. All in all, the phone is great, worth the money, really like it. I had the Sony Experia before this and it started playing up after a year... I hope this will last longer, my friend has had his 2 years and no problems.",0
5,This phone by far was the best I have ever used very smooth running and attractive design. Shame i managed to drop it down the toilet after 3 days and now the touchscreen is unresponsive. If buying this phone make sure you get a waterproof case.,1
5,"I am used to Samsung phones, took a while to get used to using the same os system in the Huawei, done slightly differently.The camera is superb. Yes it's really good phone for the money.",0
5,"Took advantage of the discounted price plus the 5 month interest free payment.First off, it's a great phone. The size I slightly smaller than my previous phone but the length of the screen makes up for any loss.The screen is clear, sharp and bright. Touch responsiveness is great too.After initial set-up, I had a play with the extended settings. Some great options, too many to mention here.Camera quality is great, even in low light. Again, plenty of options included with the stock camera app.Battery life is pretty good too. Can easily get 2 days out of a full charge with moderate use.For a mid range phone, I'm delighted with it.",0
3,"This review is one of two halves. First the good.Great hardware. Exceptional camera as you've probably seen in the reviews and the UI is easy to use. The screen itself is crisp and sharp - and at a nice high resolution. Phone is very responsive, and I find the memory capacity more than enough for my app needs. Battery often lasts a couple of days, and a supercharge can be done from near empty in under an hour. I like also how easy it is to link your phone to a screen, either via USB C at work or say a FireStick at home. The phone compass is a bit iffy, but generally good enough for navigation and bearings. The finger sensor is slightly fussy I've found in terms of matching the angle you registered a fingerprint at. Facial recognition works well, but as a security feature I would turn it off - it doesn't have the depth perception capability of the Apple phones.Now the downside. And it's a big one for me personally. Huawei's EMUI operating system is set to aggressively preserve battery life. This means that any non-core app gets put in to sleep mode after about 30 minutes of inactivity, and this includes WhatsApp. For me, and many others I bet, WhatsApp is their principal comms platform. If you don't log in to WA for about 30 minutes it stops polling for messages. Many a time I've checked in after a few hours and received a ton of messages in one go. I've changed all the possible settings (and there are a LOT that are hidden away) but none of these fix it. I've spoken to Huawei support and they advised wiping my phone, then suggested I contact WhatsApp for a fix!!  Look around, there are many other posts on this subject. If WA messenger is important to you, then I would not recommend this phone with EMUI 9, at least until they fix this key issue.",1
2,My phone came with a pixel missing in the bottom! The facial recognition doesn't work in high sunlight/with shades on. The screen scratches SO EASILY (had a bit of sand in my pocket and now my screen is very scratched) on Facebook watching videos - the full screen mode only covers half of the screen horizontally with no fix (Release date of Android P on March 7th did not fix problem as I was previously told) and some Snapchat filters do not work! I expected A LOT MORE from a phone that is so expensive. Very disappointed.,0
5,Cannot make this product as it was a present for my grandson but my grandson has told me that he really likes it a lot and he  wanted it for a app to watch films on and he said it works really well,0
2,"This phone was such a disappointment! The battery life is not good at all! It is a bit laggy as well! The only good thing I can say about it is, the front camera. I'm returning this phone.",0
5,"Camera quality is way above the race from any handset out there currently. If you are into photography this should be your goto choice. Further battery life on a normal use stays for two days comfortably. Last but not the  least its looks, its undoubtedly the best looking premium model in your hand. Design and color asthetics simply ace the charts.Display is not 10/10 under sun unlike other few flagships but its a personal choice.Happy purchasing.",1
3,"I have the p20 lite, the phone itself is pretty good. However I do not understand why the p20 lite came with such cheap headphones when looking at photos of other reviews the p20 comes with better quality and completely different headphones.",0
5,"With finger print and face recognition, this phone for the price is hard to beat. The screen quality is great, it lasts a good 2 days before needing recharging, and does everything I néed from a phone and more. Battery charging is very fast too, and with 64mb, it will not run out of space.",0
4,"The phone is awesome, very fast and intuitive.The problem is that the charger (I bought the UK version) doesn't fit in the socket since it is too small! I don't really want to buy an adapter, so in case I ask for another charger that actually fits or at least for a EU one.",0
5,"Great phone, good camera, battery life and features for university students like me. The only thing to mention is that the maximum volume can be higher, when doing videocalls but apart from that, the phone is great and affordable for university students like me.",0
5,Had Galaxy S5 and from day one always took bad pictures.  the camera is brilliant.  No faults at the moments,1
5,"seriously good phone, no complaints, great price for such a phone. Move over Samsung/Apple. Whole family are now converts.",1
5,"A great price and I am amazed by the quality. Had it a couple of months now and it does everything it says and more. Great battery life, even when used a lot, brilliant camera and all the apps that are preloaded are actually useful, unlike some phones. Takes a couple of weeks to get used to dual sim but once I had it was a breeze. I am really really pleased with it.",0
4,Overall performance is satisfactory.  However fingerprint recognition doesn't work.  Of all the times I've tried logging in using this facility my fingerprint has been rejected.  I have to rely on using my PIN every time.,0
2,I wouldn't suggest this phone. I got it because it was quite cheap and could have 2 sims but lags almost all the time.Face recognision works 50%,0
5,"Got this phone as my old one was getting a bit outdated and I saw an opportunity to treat myself around the Christmas period. It's been a real treat to use and the first phone I've ever been particularly attached to. Given that this is the ""Lite"" equivalent of this product, I feel like I'm getting a premium product.",0
5,Really impressed with this phone and can't beat the price either. I was dubious about the brand but having tried a colleagues out was impressed and have no regrets. Just wish the battery lasted a bit longer but can't have everything in a sub £250 phone with these features,0
5,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review. I must admit i have used the other system for many years, but instantly when i received the phone and unboxed it, it felt instantly familiar. The packaging is of a premium brand and implies quality before you have even turned the phone on. Once you turn on the phone you quality of the full front screen with the notch dazzles you and makes you want to get straight into downloading apps. Once you have downloaded the basics everything is smooth and quick, whether its loading a new app to switching between them. The camera, well what can i say its amazing, i don't know what voodoo happens but you point it a a person - the camera pops up 'portrait' point its at a dog- it says dog, cat it says cat, and for those who have to insta every meal point it at your fish and chips and it says food. What is this magic?! The camera adjusts to suit each scene, phenomenal. The freedom and range of the android system will never cease to amaze me- if you don't like the text messaging app, just download another the freedom is there for anything and with the 128GB storage it will take a while to fill up. The Battery is like most phones on the market, will survive the 1st day easily but will struggle to make a second day without charging. If you are looking for an android phone i would recommend the Huawei P20 to you, a good reliable phone.",0
3,"Its dual sim but the memory card uses the 2nd sim card slot so its one or the other, how stupid of the Chinese i sold mine on.",0
5,"Ordered this for my wife because her screen smashed on her Samsung S7, this is a similar standard if not better. She loves the camera",1
5,There is nothing to dislike about this phone it is brilliant and my other phone did not have enough storage but this phone with a massive 64 gigabite. Download know problems brilliant best buy,1
5,"So far i am very happy with the purchase of this phone, i highly recommend buying this phone if your looking for something that's at a good price with fantastic hardware.",0
5,Excellent product. Face recognition a bit hit and miss but not a issue for me. Great camera and phone which is why I bought it.,0
5,"This is one of the best phones I have ever had. Its simple, huge screen, amazing camera...and the best its the price! I really recommend it!!",1
5,Very good screen images and exceptional camera.  Battery life as good as any other brand. Good all round phone for a reasonable price.,1
5,"Really cool phone! Working well so far, couldn't get this colour in my country so v happy to find it from a recognised seller.",0
1,My god this phone have so many problems.I've been using LG phones for a while and never run on problems like this.Doesn't not worth.People who give good reviews are people who dont know.This phone have so many bugs its impossible to use.,1
5,"Wow, just incredible. I've been using this phone for the last couple of weeks and let me tell you this was the best purchase I made in years.I will the pros and cons.Pros -Beautiful pictures, as an owner of a dslr and mirrorless camera, which both are worth over 1000 pounds each. I must say the camera isn't far from the quality, in fact in some scenarios it has even surpassed them, incredible piece of technology.The battery life is also impressive. I have been giving this device a hard time over using it 24/7 and I can go 1 day and half without charging it. Which btw charging it to full takes me less then 1hr!Gaming performance, I have yet to experience any sort of lag whatsoever. I run multiple retro consoles on it as well at maximum settings with no issues whatsoever. The amazing part is that even at low battery it keeps performing just the same as full. Which is kinda amusing really.Design, at first I was sceptical with the curved style hauwei went with, however it turned out great and I got really into it sometimes I tend to forget its curved. It also gives it that premium looks so be ready for people to be staring at your phone rather then you. I went with aura colour even though I owned black coloured phones for decades now. I must say I'm digging the looks.Software, I love hauwei os but ofc I might be based as I've been using hauwei products for a while now so it could be I'm that used to them. However, all latest android features are present and some extra ones that only huawei offers.Sensors, fingerprint reader is super fast, face registration must be done well to work as intended. Took me a couple of trys. Latest Bluetooth so it connect to everything even ps4 pro controller.Sound, just great, dolby at os is surprisingly good as well.Cons,I have yet to find anything bad, I'm sorry.",1
1,got the phone yesterday and after setting it up I turned on the camera as It was much talked about on TV. I was most disappointed to find out that you can only take 40  mp in 4:3 format and you can't operate the zooming in this mode. if you switch to 16:9 the resolutions drop down to 6 mp (poor). similarly wide angle pics and portraits are in less than 10 mp resolution only - NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM £700 PHONE. the screen is not bright enough and screen resolution is only FHD (1K) at best - by comparison my LG V30 has 2K screen resolution. Internet connection is poor too as it struggles to connect to my 5g router signal - I have connected it to my slower router signal the 2.4 g but even that is patchy. I am going to try the phone for a week to see if it grows on me otherwise it is going back.,1
5,"People who bought this phone for dual sim have to sacrifice the memory card slot for their second sim, if storage space is an issue you should get the 512gb version if you want tonnes of memory and the use of dual sims.",0
2,I do have this phone (although bought on contract somewhere for my kids but use it for awhile)Pro -nice amazing camera front selfie and rearCons -The video quality is not good its pixelated and a bit blurry when I used fb liveWatching you tube can be a bit paleBluetooth connection to my car jvc unit fro some reason I am unable to do ( even my son honor 5c)It hurts my eyes watching for a lot time even with eye comfort feature on itA bit laggy,0
5,"Amazing phone, I would definitely recommend for someone looking for a budget phone that performs well and has a good camera. One downside to this phone is the battery life, it rarely lasts a whole day even when barely utilising the phone.An upside though is the camera, for a phone of this price I didn't expect such a good camera. Very good in indoor lighting and can take amazing shots in the outdoors. The phone comes with a few apps already installed on it but they're not much of a bother and don't take up too much space.The speaker is quite good quality but is only placed on one side of the phone so dont you'll be getting more sound in one ear than the other.This phone can run all social media apps; Snapchat, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter all run very smoothly.",0
4,"Love it so far. It's quick to transfer data from your old phone, it's easy to set up, it's bright & quick. It comes with a lot of, to me, pointless apps which took me a while to sort out, but that helped get to know the phone, so not so awful. Obviously, it's pretty & sleek, but as a mainly social media user & Internet browser, so far, it's the best & quickest I've had, plus it's so easy to navigate&get used to. My only reservation is the price ;I'm scared to drop it or damage it! I bought a back case which fits perfectly but still... Great phone but too pretty to drop!",1
4,"I got it in a lighting deal, it was a bargain. The mobile works well, beautiful screen and designed. I'm not a big fan of the notch but I don't mind after a while.  The camera is pretty good, sound is OK, in general aspects the phone is good. I recommend this phone at a price around 220...",0
5,Excellent phone  very happy.  Runs all my apps plus more. Super fast for my requirements.  Nice and sharp screen.  Trying to get. Used to its ratio but overall very impressed.  Battery life.  I get a full day. Normal use.  For me normal use. Is various apps  on most. Of the day. Emails. Web.. Video.  Drone apps.  Speakers built in are not great.,0
5,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review.First impressions of the product were great. The phone looks and feels premium. It comes with a pre-installed screen protector, and there's a slim clear gel case included in the box so you can ensure your device is protected from day one at no extra cost.Also in the box is a USB A to C charging cable, UK mains charging plug, USB C headset, USB C to 3.5mm audio jack adapter for using standard headphones, and a SIM tray removal tool. It was easy to transfer the contacts, media and settings from my old handset as part of the setup process.The main thing I use my phone for, apart from WhatsApp and general web browsing, is taking photos. I'm very happy with the camera quality and features. I thought the Artificial Intelligence functionality would be a bit of a gimmick but so far it's worked well at identifying the type of scene and tweaking the settings for optimal results.The screen is large, sharp and has vibrant colours, and the built-in speaker is loud and clear, ideal for sat nav purposes or listening to music. The front-mounted fingerprint reader is lightning fast, and can also be used as a physical navigation key (press to back, hold to go home, right to open the app switcher).I wasn't initially sold on the ""notch"" which houses the front-facing camera, earpiece speaker and notification LED, but have grown to like it. It provides a place for your clock, battery and notification icons without taking up space on the main screen. You can also hide the notch which darkens the area behind it and makes it almost invisible, but now I've got used to it, I prefer to keep it visible.Battery life is good, and with 6GB RAM and a decent CPU, it's very snappy to use. There's a generous 128GB of onboard storage which I think is more than I'll ever need, but definitely handy to have. The operating  system is EMUI 8.1, which in turn is based on Android 8.1. Huawei haven't gone overboard with tweaks and customisations, so the experience is fairly clean. There are a number of Huawei stock apps that can't be removed, but I have enabled the App Drawer so I can keep this hidden away with only the apps I regularly use.Battery life is very good - I would say on an average day when I go to bed I still have around 60% battery left, and even on a heavy usage day I still regularly have more than 30%.Overall, an impressive handset and certainly one I'd recommend.",0
4,"The phone looks amazing, most function are very well,but the picture especially the red colour seems changed too much from original,the WiFi setting is hard to find  and should come with different luanguage  inputting.",0
5,"Bought this phone wondering if i had done right, seriously have to say it was a excellent choice. It worked perfectly and was exceptional vale. Highly recommended.",0
5,"Great build quality. Smooth and easy to use interface. Amazing camera. Only had 3 days but loving it. If u have read reviews and are tempted, then I totally recommend. Forget the American and England propoganda.",0
4,"Bought on a special, around £175 + VAT - for that money this phone is exceptional - even at the full price it's a great buy, but at this price makes it better!",0
5,"This is a great phone, update is generally a month behind but regular ie - Google will release Sept patch, phone will receive August patch. For my need, the phone is fast, especially as I was upgrading from a 3 year old Motorola, screen is sharp and bright. The phone came bundled with a bunch of apps, most of which I deleted immediately or replaced with Google's version. The finger print reader is fast and accurate, battery not as good as I was expecting, it'll last a day but that's about it, def need charging over night if you're a heavy user but it charges fast so that's a plus. For the price, I paid £210 direct from amazon, it's an absolute bargain",0
4,"This phone is really nice and make amazing pictures but the battery life goes very fast and take more time to charge, the rest of the phone I would recommend",0
4,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review. I come from using Android phones and usually like a minimal operating system so I was a bit sceptical about trying Huawei's version. It did indeed take me some time to get used to it but the innovative features within the phone convinced me to persist and I am glad I did. The phone is slick. It is speedy, a great example is how quickly it unlocks using face unlock but there is never any lag and it's easy to navigate the operating system. It's customisable, if you don't like Huawei's home screen ('launcher') then you can change it. You can amend the colour scheme on the screen and even the intensity of the colours. There are so many options but if it is overwhelming they are easy to ignore. The battery life is incredible, seriously the best I have had. It easily lasts a day and once I forgot my charger and lasted almost 36 hours. The camera....the AI is really something. It instantly knows what you are taking a photo of and adjusts the settings to make the camera look great. Perfect photos with no tweaking. For me a stock Android setup will always be my favourite but I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new handset, it looks great and is packed with features.",1

I have been using this phone for a while now and all I can say is the phone is an amazing all rounder. The main feature of these phones is the multi lens Leica camera. The camera has advanced AI which will assist you in getting the best from any subject you are taking a picture of. The phone runs the latest EMUI 8, which is Hauweis own front for the Android operating system. It is slightly different to using other android phones but after a little bit you easily get the hang of navigating it. The phone itself is very lightweight and sleek with a glass backed metal case. The screen is pin sharp and the built in speakers gives excellent sound quality. The is the latest style usb3 port for charging the ohone, this also replaces the standard 3.5mm earphone socket, to use earphones you use an adaptor in this port. One thing missing is the ability to upgrade memory on the phone as there is no space for a memory card. So make sure you get the model with the right amount of memory you think you will need. If you are unsure of which phone to get at your next upgrade then I would definitely recommend the Hauwei P20.",1
1,"Cannot understand how anyone could give this phone anything than a minus 5 rating.I have bought phones at 1/3 the price and had better quality.One very poor and bug ridden device.This thing crashed continually, apps disappeared while the phone was not in use , tried resetting 3 times, same result .You can't choose notification sounds,have 4-5 social media apps and they all sound the same , the led's are so tiny they can only be seen in a totally dark room. The phone is laden with garbage apps that can't be removed and the control buttons are conveniently placed to be under your fingers when you hold the phone meaning that the least movement sees the phone volume changing or the phone being locked, great when trying to type a message on the utterly puny keyboard.Returned .  And don't think returning an item is easy anymore ...... Amazon no longer collect , no Post Office return either .  Ended up having  to do a 30 mile round trip to an obscure back street shop . Better yet , the list of ""drop off "" points is useless and wrong , 5 places I tried said they have never dealt with parcel services or Amazon ,they couldn't understand why Amazon list them  ...........  How to lose customers.",0
3,"The camera is good, the screen is good. It look swish and posh and expensive in your hand.The camera, I mean wow. It's only supposedly 5x optical zoom and you get to 50x using digital but it's amazing how good it looks considering. Low light shots are great but you need to hold the camera steady for a few seconds for them unless I'm doing something wrong. The wide angle lens is just great for capturing a lot of rooms indoors and also for landscapes outside.So what's the problem? Well it's a bit too big. It doesn't fit in my coat pocket any more. It's uncomfortable in the hand and causes an ache after a while. The curved screen looks cool and expensive but at the end of the day a flat screen is just so much more usable both in terms of visibility and in terms of touch responsiveness.  With this screen I was getting phantom touches from holding it at the side and failure to touch sometimes on UI elements on the side of the screen.Face recognition is good in the light but checking your phone in the night- forget it, at least in my experience. Fingerprint unlocking is fast and accurate.Probably way too early to tell but battery life seems good.Ask me anything in the comments.",0
4,"I used to have a Huawei ascend 7 (or a G7-L01) so I'm used to a Huawei and I know how good they are.The P20 lite is totally fab, you can get some amazing shots with the camera. The depth of field shots are fab, there's the portrait mode or another mode where you can actually adjust the amount of depth of field! (see my photo)The ultra battery mode now allows you to pick 3 apps for you to use in ultra mode which is much better (the ascend 7 only really allowed sms)I decided on the lite because its much cheaper and it has a memory card slot (why the hell have they omitted that on the P20 I've no idea) I could put in a128gb card and have more memory than a P20!!You won't be disappointed!If anything I'd prefer a bigger battery, but it does last a whole day under fairly heavy use.The phone works quicker than the ascend 7 due to the processer and ram.The fingerprint scanner works really well! Even put my finger on upsidedown and it still works!And it has faster charging 😊",1
1,"Love the phone. Got the phone delivered next day but one of the screen pixels was dead, Amazon replaced it straight away and new one came the next day.Fantastic phone! Good battery life. Screen is great! Multiple open apps run without any problems. All in all a brilliant phone for a budget price. Highly recommended.Update: 25/01/19Sadly the phone doesn't charge at times when plugged in. I have done full resets but still the issue appears at random. I have decided to return the phone back to Amazon. Amazon have been amazing throughout this process and even are accepting accessories I bought for this phone through them even though I don't have the original packing for one of the items. Customer service at the best.No more Huawei phones for me, twice bitten.",1
4,"Nowadays it seems no one is interested in a phones core function to establish and maintain a consistent call connection. This device exceeds expectations with a seamless and resilient handoff on the move.As many of you know mobile phones are basically low power radio transceivers designed specifically to connect to the mobile networks radio access network. In doing so the device converts your voice into an electrical signal, which is then transmitted via radio waves.This Huawei device establishes and holds a voice call robustly even over more densely populated networks, which is an important aspect for me at this time. The handsets speaker doesn’t require the user to precisely and firmly place it across the ear, as the transmitted call projects well and with clarity at all angles typically used in that way.Unfortunately there’s no star rating option for voice call quality, if there were I’d submit with 4.",0
4,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review.On unpacking the box I was impressed that a screen protector had been fitted and a bumper case was included. A nice touch from Huawei. Another thoughtful addition is a USB C adapter allowing you to listen to music with your favourite earphones. The phone feels nice to hold and the Huawei Phone Clone makes transferring to the new phone very easy.The screen is clear and easy on the eye and the battery charges super fast which is very useful. I was impressed with the battery too.I had a Huawei phone some years ago with a small memory and an SD card for extra storage which I found difficult to use. No problem with this phone as it has an excellent 128gb memory, enough for all my photos, music and Apps with plenty to spare.The face recognition is lightning fast - so much so that I have turned it off for the  time being. I like to see the photo on the lock screen and the little boot icon showing the number of steps I’ve done is rather cute.The camera is amazing and has produced some lovely photos. The night mode ias truly brilliant- giving me a decent photo of an amaryllis that was taken in pitch dark. There is a lot to explore on this camera and it will take time to discover it all.It’s a pity that there isn’t a way to allocate individual text message tones to your contacts on the phone itself. I have found an App that allows you to avail yourself of this facility but it would be better not to have to use a third party App.All in all it’s a pretty good phone with a decent camera at a reasonable price.",0
4,"2nd phone arrived today, after the 1st one had a non UK 3 pin configuration that did not fit ! The Single top pin is almost in line (just 5 millimetres above the 2 bottom pins).  The replacement phone has the same non UK plug !!!! Grrrrr.(UPDATE:- We have just been talking to someone who has this phone & same plug - apparently, they say that the centre pin has to be pushed up and that it clicks ?? into place?? - if so, why the h###' don't they say so.Amazon are also unapproachable - no email, no nothing to raise an issue/question with them or if there is it is VERY WELL HIDDEN.Is Amazon's Ai listening? because no one else is at home it would appear).Phone looks great and appears a good quality build.The Sim card tray ejection is by a long stainless steel pin which needed a hard press - that was scary as it felt like you might push too hard and damage the inside of the phone.  This is my wife's phone, and she called me to help as she couldn't push the pin in hard enough to eject the card tray.This isn't too disconcerting as its unlikely to be used again once your Sim is in.",0
5,It's not perfect (not sure any phone is) but for the price this is a very impressive handset. I'd question the need to spend more. The p20 pro adds an extra camera and the mate 20 pro has newer processor but both those phones are too big for me. The p20 is a nice size. There's 2 really great things about this phone. The camera is great. That night mode can get pictures handheld I cannot get on proper cameras. They're probably suitable for A5 and certainly for sharing on social media. In good light again the camera impresses. I sometimes switch the AI off because it can be garish if it picks some options such as greenery. I prefer more natural photos with it off but some will love it. Video is less impressive. Stabilisation only at HD rather than 4k. Still good but not excellent. Slow motion works well. Battery is really good on this. Very rare to fail to make a day and I have watched synched and lots of apps running. You may need to manually change settings for battery for apps you want always working from auto to manual or they might not run properly. Performance is excellent. Very quick in day to day use and runs cool. I like to leave it in performance mode as scroll rate is super smooth. In standard it's still good but not as fast. Performance mode doesn't seem to affect battery too bad either. Maybe 10 percent less at end of day. Usually about 30 to 50 percent left by bedtime. Screen is lovely and vibrant and bright. Sharp too. Only HD rather than 2k but it feels sharper than my previous 2k phone. I don't like the vibration motor (too weak yet too loud) and call quality is only ok. The tiny ear piece sounds a bit muffled and you can't whisper as the microphone is not that sensitive. Speaker is acceptable but a bit tinny at high volumes. Face ID is not that reliable. UI is reasonable but I prefer to use my own homescreen. Evie launcher works well on this phone. Much more customisable than Huaweis own. This feels like a flagship phone. It has to be 5 stars though 4.5 would be more accurate. I wouldn't pick this for business use due to call quality and it's not fully waterproof,1
5,Well I'm so impressed with Huawei P20 pro. As a camera phone it's just top notch. I put some samples on. I'm no pro but I think there impressive.Battery life is very good. As a heavy gamer I average about 2 days life. The screen is sharp and good colour production.Sound is very good and call quality very good. Runs all the latest games with no lag.Now onto imo let the phone down a bit.The camera bump on the back seems just odd.The 4k recording is ok at only 30fps seems bizarre when cheaper phones do 4k 60fps all day long.No wireless charging in 2018. Again missed a trick.I've just updated to Android 9.0 with EMUI 9. It's fast lightweight. Seems really good is. Shame not stock.Great loud ringtones. Good colour choices. The twighlight does look sweet.Great waterproofing a must today. Very good quick charge on average 90 mins from flat to full.So all in all a well recommended smartphone. The only reason I would get the Samsung Galaxy S9. Is to get the 4k 60fps mode.If thats not a deal breaker. Then yes get the P20 pro you won't regret it.,1
1,During the install from a google back up the phone froze and reset... it then got stuck in a cycle of restarting and showing the eRecovery screen. after trying all the options i called Huawei customer support who then went through more options and decided it needs to go back to amazon . Its NOT dual sim as advertised either. Very poor start,0
5,"Everything physical about this phone is excellent. I upgraded from the Huawei P20, which was excellent already. It's let down (again) by EMUI and the pester ware called HiCare which intrudes on your day to day usage continuously, and seems impossible to fully eradicate. One important niggle is the screen and rear glass. I had it for 3 days without a case or screen protector and picked up 3 scratches despite 'paranoid care' being taken. But it's now fully protected.",0
5,"Great value via Warehouse Deals, brand new with stickers intact and no marks.  Performs as expected, sound and camera excellent for price range of phone (£174.xx) after discount.  Good clear screen, light weight and no noticeable lag in transitions.  Oreo 8, NFC and everything that I need.  Good integration with Google/Microsoft android apps, SMS from PC outlook to phone!",0
5,"I was gutted to give up my windows phone and go over to android after previous android experiences were rubbish.  This thing is absolutely amazing. Knocks spots off the competition.  Build quality excellent, screen excellent, camera(s) excellent, performance and speed excellent.  The user interface is brilliant as well.  Give up the overpriced binkered iphones and join the Huawei revolution.",0
5,This phone is bloody amazing!!! I wanted a phone with a good camera but this is unbelievable. It finds the subject in the shots and blurs out the background and the effects are amazing. I had a Samsung galaxy s7 before it nearly went in fire and this camera is just as good if nit better. There are loads of features that I haven't figured out yet but so far so good. Best phone for the best price.,1
4,"Good little product for such a small amount of money u get same quality as a high price phone however the bad points for me after 1 month is that the face recognition sometimes does not see your face in diferrent light/ sunlight , ans secondly and more important i cant get reception i mean it is so poor so signal quality is very low . Apart from that i think  that u get what u pay for and more with this phone but u may need to go outside to make a phone call :)",0
5,"I have had this phone for a few months. I really like it. The finger print scanner means you don't have to enter a pin. It is a dual SIM phone which is handy when traveling outside Europe, you can pick up a local SIM and still be able to receive messages on your original SIM.",0
5,"I bought this for my daughter who wears out phones about every two years. She's gone through two motorola G  series phones in 4 years so I thought I'd try something a bit more upmarket. If she wears this out it's back to the cheapies!She loves this phone, as well as the camera and the features.",0
4,On the whole a very good phone. I will however need to get a case as the back is so smooth it slides of any surface which isn't 100% flat at an almost imperceptibly slow pace. Ill leave it on a book or the arm of the sofa and a few minutes later ill hear a thud as it has jumped to its doom.On the good side its not broken from the falls yet!,0
5,Had this mobile for over 2 weeks now and tested everything on it including dualism and everything is working fine.I use the mobile alot and online too and battery last all day before it needs a charge in late evening.This is a quality mobile and worth every penny.,0
5,"For the price, it has one of the best cameras on any phone I've used. Perfect budget smartphone. Would benefit from OnePlus' dash charger system as charging is sloooooow in comparison but at under £220 it really is an impressive allround device.",1
2,"Adequate as a phone, camera is poor quality and not a patch on my previous Samsung S4,  Would not recommend.",1
4,"Having owned this phone since release there are several areas which I feel need addressing from other reviews.Overall the phone is great.  The still camera is great - on par with the Pixel 2/Pixel 3 and other high end phones for bokeh effect etc.Video is a slightly different story.  the camera app seems to simply crop the sensor output for 1080P output and so the averaging between groups of 4 pixels is lost reducing image quality.  The auto focus also seems to wander more when shooting video as does the brightness or more accurately the brightness of the object you want to video.  In a backlit scene it constantly wants to normalisethe exposure to the background liht source.  The other issues with the video is that the Image stabilistation only works at lower resolutions and framerates (ie 1080p, 30 fps).  it would be nice if this worked at higher framerates ie 1080P60.Software - slightly quirky EMUI 8 interface (still waiting for an EMUI 9 update) which is to be expected from a chinese phone.  hopefully the OS will get closer to Vanilla android over time.Battery Life - great - longest lasting phone i have had.  i genreally charge to abour 60 - 80% each morning and still at 40% by the next morning.Connectivity - the GSM/3G/4G radio is great gettig signal where most other phones do not.  it also supports native Wi-Fi calling (Three network) so keeps you connected even when there is no cellular signal.Storage - 128GB is enough for me.  I would like a storage slot for microSD but after a 8 months use i am still only using 20% of the available storage (about 100GB).Screen - resolution is fine, my only wish is it would go dimmer so reading in a dark room would be less straining on the eyes.  otherwise colours are vibrant crisp.Screen Glass and camera Glass - very soft and my only main critisism.  the camera glass on the back of the phone scratches very easily and well worth getting a decent case that provide protection.  such a shame when the snapper is the KEY feature of this phone.  the glass on the front of the phone is also very soft and prone to scratching if the factory fitted protector is removed - something to watch out for.warranty/return - i had a fault with the SIM card where when the phone was hot (ie after fast charging) the SIM would disconnect and I would be unable to make calls/use data.  I returned the phone to the reailer and the Huawei returns process took over and I received a brand new phone.",1
5,"I am 63 and a phone tecky. This is the best value for money phone I have ever had the pleasure to own. I don't write reviews, but having read so many negatives about this phone, I felt I had to write about my experience with this particular phone. From opening the box in the morning, to setting up, all transferance of contacts, photos etc etc, including downloading 7368 tracks of music on 11different playlists, 79 albums and 17 films, all to external sd card, making 3 calls, receiving and answering 3 emails teatime beckoned so I called it a day and felt very happy with every aspect of my new beautifully designed Huawei phone. That and the fact that it's camera is superb, it sounds good too. Battery life is second to none and charges very fast as well. For the price I paid I cannot find a single relevant fault. In the new year I shall be upgrading to the P20 pro, deffo. I will pass this P20 lite down the line to a friend who's Galaxy 8 is on its way out. Excellent  value phone. Oh! yes it has its own security built in and so far that's all it requires.This is a genuine review of the P20 lite having purchased it online from Amazon. I do not write reviews generally unless a product deserves it. Honestly  buy it and see for yourself.",1
4,This was a gift for family,0
1,"Amazing phone, photo quality is great, speed of the phone is unbelievable.  However dealing with Huawei when something goes wrong is another matter, you are better off with a Samsung as dealing with this company is terrible and it's not worth the headache.  Really poor customer service is only the beginning.",1
3,"I am  in my mid 70's and cannot operate a phone with the dexterity if a teenager. I find that its main attraction - 40 mega pixels and a great lens is nearly impossible to use with no user manual. I have wasted a considerable time trying to operate it, and I still have great difficulty. On that basis, I would consider going back my previous phone. I have had many phones in the past, but none have caused me any major problems with the exception of the HUAWEI P20 PRO. On that basis, I certainly would not buy another Huawei phone. The large memory and big battery are fine but that is not why I bought the phone. I have discovered how to use certain aspects by trial & error, and I suppose that If I live for many years I will eventually master all it offers. At the moment, to me,  it is just an ordinary phone.",0
4,"This phone is incredible! The screen quality is exceptional as is the battery life. It takes good photos on the actual camera but social media apps like Snapchat and Instagram severely decrease the quality of videos especially on 'stories' which is a real irritant of mine. However that isn't the phones fault but the fact that these apps were mainly built for the IOS platform.I've had the phone since August 2018 and it's been amazing, the battery life is still perfect however I went without a case for a while which was a major mistake as the back of the phone is a huge fingerprint magnet and I dropped the phone on concrete which smashed the whole thing but I loved the phone so much I got it repaired.I'd recommend this phone to anyone of any age and it even comes with a ""simple"" mode for the elderly or young. The phone looks beautiful too and is really fast plus it's growing in popularity! For the price you pay it's an exceptional phone, just make sure you get a case!",0
3,I have been spoilt with the Honor Pro 8 which is a real heavy duty fast workhorse - this was for more personal use -  so I was slightly dissapointed to find it wasnt like the Pro 8If however I look at it as a stand alone phone - it is generally a good phone which packs a fair punch for its price,1
4,Great phone the only problem I have with it is the USB keeps disconnecting and only works to change it. It won't connect to my car's internet. I have sent it back and I m waiting for a replacement to be sent.,0
1,"I was unfortunate to have to return not 1 but 2 of the fones as they had identical faults on them,ie simcard drawer could not be opened with the pin. It wvas a present for my husband and he had to take a train to the sorting office drop-off twice to the label free return facility. Most disappointing. Uncanny that I received 2 with the same fault. Now have a Honor7X which is ok apart from having to go on a train yet again to the Vodafone shop for a nano simcard which is necessary to transfer the rest from the old fone. Sorry had to give both 1 star.",1
5,"Battery life is good, quick response using apps, the phone is duel sim but you can only use two sims if you don't use a sd card this shouldn't be a problem yet as the phone has a large memory.I'm impressed and I would certainly buy the phone again.  I bought the phone as  a Amazon factory return, I couldn't fault its condition",0
5,So far all good still getting used to it great price for a great phone camera is fantastic the apps mostly same as iPhone some apps not available but it's not a concern definitely wouldn't go back to iPhone,1
2,"Decent phone, screen is good everything works fine but the battery is terrible it lasts about 2 hours switching between Snapchat and Facebook, would not recommend it for anyone using it for that",0
2,"This phone is OK, however upon using it.  I find it really slow, so slow using any app.  some of the features are OK, just OK. Its a cheap phone and that exactly what it is.",0
5,Looks the part but don’t no anything else till Xmas dayFollow up son loves it best phone he has had .fast battery great and pictures,1
5,"Had about 6 months, heavy use all day, still like new despite dropping it numerous times, really good phone, top quality would buy again for sure",0
5,Great phone but just worried about the outcome of our security due to older issues with the software and Google etc . Time will tell I guess. Ps camera is amazing.,0
4,"This model has a few very small issues but the quality, speed and overall performance is excellent",0
5,Great little phone delivered promptly. Got warm when first updating all apps and the initial startup but now a fantastic budget phone. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a bargain.,0
1,"I've talked to Huawei tech support and they acknowledged the problem and they assured that this should be resolved in future software releases, but! today 29th Sep 2018, a few months later this problem still exists.The problem - you may not mind if you will never need to record sound with external mic on mini jack plug - the phone ignores such external microphone when you record video! Instead it insists to use internal mic.I've tried this - https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00MPDYGBE/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1Then I tried a regular head-set which I use for calls and Skype, etc. - the same! Video recording ignores external jack microphone.Other two phones I've tried, including an Iphone, had no problems and used this external mic and recorded audio through it.It seems that video recording app of this Huawei (maybe other Huaweis?) just does not work with external microphone whereas the rest of phone, Skype, etc. does.",0
1,I have big issue with the phone. The GPS doesn't work at all so you can not use so many major apps.Return it,0
5,Was a bit wary of leaving Samsung and buying a Huawei phone but I am quite impressed. If you are an android user it is easy to get used to.The screen scratches quite easily is the only down fall really.,0
5,"Good light phone. Priced per the specs. Till after 2 weeks of using, battery is good.Comes loaded with loads of Huawei apps which eats up some space. But camera is good.But on the side I find some plastic feeling and seems the plastic is not aligned properly. Glass on back and front.So for now 4 🌟 as overall I am happy.",0
5,"I have an iPhone X and bought the Huawei P20 Lite for my son. It has a sleek design, great camera, battery life and user interface. Highly recommended!",0
5,"I always feel uncomfortable buying something like a phone from the internet. But I needed a new phone, and I wanted it to have great memory as that was the biggest downfall of my previous phone. Found this were it had a really good offer on it on the Amazon prime event, and went for it. Also something I'm not comfortable with because I like to think things through. But it turned out it was a good thing, suddenly I had a new phone without having to spend months researching.This phone is an upgrade in every way from my last phone (Sony Xperia M4 Aqua), minus the whole waterproof thing. The camera is better quality and faster. Has so much memory I don't have worry about deleting apps everytime something wants to update. I can take thousands of photos, around a hundred short videos, have the apps I want and still have a ton of memory left. I like the Huawei operating system, where all the apps are on one page rather than having a separate screen with everything and a shortcut screen. It was easy to get use to and know how to work it.The one problem I can think of is connecting it to the computer. When you connect it you have to go into the settings on the phone and 'Allow HiSuite to use HDB' every time. Even if you leave it on for the next time, the phone won't connect. So you have to turn it off and on again. This going and changing the settings for some reason is a really common thing with this phone.Another weird thing is the touch screen isn't good when it is laying flat. When held at an angle it's perfect, but when I lay it flat on a table and try and use it, the screen doesn't seem to register that I'm touching it. Or if it does it won't do it well and act as if I touched the wrong thing, or just take a long time to do what I want only to back out of it. Like I said it only happens when the phone is flat, but I've never had this problem with my last touch screen phones.I have had this phone for around 4 months now and I am happy I brought it.",1
5,"Still trying to work out what is wrong with this handset, as it wasn't ridiculously expensive and is an absolutely top notch product. Screen quality is sharp, camera's great, bluetooth and WiFi are up to scratch, and the battery life is astounding. I've bought a screen protector but haven't actually put it on yet, no damage to the screen despite a few clumsy knocks.5* across the board - after a month of use I can find no issues and would recommend this phone. It's rare to find no issues with a handset, and I would definitely buy it again if I needed two phones for some reason.",0
4,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review.This is an impressive phone even though it is the Lite version. First of all the build quality is very good - made of glass and aluminium. Very nice and solid to hold. Then you notice a big 6.3” HD screen. Its not AMOLED, but is still very sharp and bright. To watch YouTube videos it is amazing.Mate 20 Lite is also fast to use too thanks to Kirin 710 processor and 4GB of RAM. Its not the latest processor but I found it handled tasks very quickly and rarely did I notice any glitch.Mate 20 Lite has 4 AI powered cameras with scene recognition. I am not big into photography but I’d say this phone takes good photos. It certainly does a good job for me and took some good photos on my winter holiday on Cairngorm mountain.The most remarkable feature is the battery life - Mate 20 Lite has huge 3750mAh battery with 9V2A Fast Charge. Couple of times with light use it lasted me 3 days! Now with normal use I consistently get 2 days. Im loving it!However there are some negatives too. Main one is the Huawei user interface. Its fast but a bit cumbersome and not intuitive. Also the phone itself is big and slippery. So much that I already damaged my screen. A case is a must.But all in all Mate 20 Lite is a great phone with many flagship features for little money. One of the best at this price point I would say.",1
5,"Pros:very light weightgreat screen resolution and contrastvery nice designvery good cameragood sound with quick performance overallCons:short battery life, i am not heavy user and it just gets me through the daywifi is not the best out theresometimes get laggy, i guess its let down by software updatesSummary: highly recommended",1
5,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review. I have been using the Huawei P20 Life for almost 2 weeks now and love it. The screen is clear with a fingerprint unlock, which works perfectly. It’s easy to set up and to personalise. Icons are easily moved from screen to screen, so you can have them just where you like them. Calls are clear with the ability to answer or make calls simply by raising the phone to your ear. The camera is amazing. It takes great quality photos and has a wealth of settings to get that perfect shot. I would happily recommend this phone.",0
5,"I love this phone.  I had an Huawei P8 Lite and lost it whilst on holiday and really like Huawei, so decided to upgrade to this little beauty.  Very fast and great internal storage available, ie. 64mb.  AND it still has room from expansion.  No taking back off etc to insert SIM or expansion storage - side drawer for this.No hesitation in recommending it to others.",0
1,"Excellent in all respects except one. Like all Huawei phones it has a very weak USB C port, don't expect more than a couple of months before it will need replacing. The good news is there are plenty of Amazon sellers selling the parts you need to fix it.Just to add. Don't bother trying to get Vodafone to repair it under warranty, they will just accuse you of damaging it yourself rather than a manufacturing defect. Repair still ""works"" but it is now becoming loose again even with a new cable.",0
2,"Chromatic aberration in photos is very bad a lot of the times, even with the master ai turned off. Very disappointed by this. Also I think that the phone very aggressively tries to save battery life. The result is that core apps are not working correctly. For example Google calendar and photos. I've missed meetings because my phone hasn't synced. This is my first and last Huawei.",0
4,Packed with features for the price BUT:Glass is cheap and will scratch to hell if you don't put tempered glass on it.No wireless charging (and type C usb) so you will end up buying new cables.Screen should have been better if it added to the price slightly.,0
4,I liked everything about the phone pleasant to use  really pleased with it my husband was impressed and found a deal with phone Co and got the same phone,0
4,"I have used this phone for a few weeks now and I absolutely love it. The camera quality is fantastic and the overall processing power is good, super smooth with no lag or delay, but the battery could be better.",0
5,"Disclaimer: I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review.The Huawei P20 is every bit the modern, beautiful smart phone with a few unique touches. Having spent the last couple of weeks testing it out I can confirm the P20 is amazing: great camera, modern design and speedy performance.If you have seen any of Huawei’s latest releases you will be familiar with the design, they have found a winning formula and are sticking with it. The all-screen design and premium build quality easily stands up to high-end handsets costing double.There are a few design decisions that will split opinion, namely the notch, front-mounted fingerprint scanner, missing headphone jack and lack of SD card. Personally, I can live with the notch (it can be switched off), but I prefer the unspoilt front with the fingerprint scanner on the back. Interestingly, the headphone jack and SD slot are present on the thinner P20 lite, but not the P20.The P20 is a joy to live with. The fingerprint scanner is quick and easy (likewise the face-recognition) and screen is bright and sharp. It ships with the latest version of Android and security updates have already been released. The Huawei skin is getting better, with options to customise it to your liking, and I haven’t experienced any lag.The camera may be overshadowed by it’s big brother (the P20 Pro), but you will not be disappointed. The AI assist is not a gimmick, it really works. This is by far the best camera experience I have seen on a smartphone. It makes my point-and-shoot photos look amazing, and it’s so easy.The P20 is a great phone in all respects, but the camera surely makes it a must-have.",1
4,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased review.The Huawei P20 is a very solid but perhaps not glamorous entry into the ever growing pantheon of Android based devices.These days it is so much harder than it used to be to decide what product to buy when considering a new phone. So why choose the P20 over the plethora of other options out there? Well let's consider it's stand-out features:- Camera -Probably the headline feature for this device is it's camera suite. Most of the focus in this department has been on it's big brother, the P20 Pro but I can tell you, the P20 is not to be sniffed at! It is a seriously impressive bit of kit and some of the snaps I have taken with it have blown me away. From examples I have seen online, I don't actually see the difference in photos taken on the P20 vs the P20 Pro and in fact they run the same camera software so all the headline features of the Pro are right here on the P20! The only difference is the hardware but from what I can see the larger number of megapixels on the Pro doesn't seem to count for much at all - so why pay the extra £200 or so for that device over this one? To be honest, I wouldn't!- Android 8.1 -I was very pleasantly surprised to learn my device came with the very latest version of Android straight out of the box! In fact within hours of first turning it on, I received a software update bringing with it the latest Android security updates. I'm hoping this shows that Huawei are committed to keeping this device as up-to-date as possible, quickly. Something seldom seen from many Android manufacturers and to be applauded.- Security Features -This is the first phone that I have used that features a fingerprint scanner, and I think I may have been spoiled with this phone. The scanner is so fast and responsive, from what I have seen from other devices, this just blows the competition out of the water! Another great feature with this sensor is the gesture support. Simply tap the sensor to go back, press and hold it to go home and swipe it to access App history. In fact this works so well that I decided to disable the normally ever-present equivalent software buttons that usually reside at the bottom of the screen. I would also like to mention the face recognition, again this is super accurate and lightning fast!The P20 is simply put a great, solid device. Possibly not the best device to come out in Q2 2018 but certainly up there or thereabouts.",1
1,"I had ordered this phone what I received was an deodorant spray, this is purposeful cheating.Do not buy....",0
5,"I bought this phone after years of owning disappointing iphones that switch off randomly and have battery life which goes from 70% one minute to 13% the next - not to mention the crap cameras iphones have always had before now. I was worried because setting up a new phone fills me with dread, its so stressful - features and buttons you have no idea how to use!? However, my new p20 lite has so far been brilliant - so so easy to use, I have even managed to move all of my photos from my iphone onto my p20 which is a big thing for someone who is so not tech savvy! I haven't taken many photos yet but the ones I have look fantastic, the phone is very light which is a big bonus if you get a sore wrist when you use a phone like I do. It doesnt have an amazing appearance and kind of just looks like any other phone but I really like this - no one judging you for owning a phone that was released 4 years ago etc etc (if it lasts that long - hopefully!) - so far very good, can see why many big companies are scared of huawei - doing great things for small prices instead of ripping us off and installing software that kills your battery with upgrades *cough* apple *cough* - BIG fan of this phone. Goodbye apple forever.",1
4,"Without writing reams, for my usage (messaging, web, camera, viewing images & videos, shopping apps, various other apps but not games), this is a superb phone, it does everything well. The crown jewel is the camera and although I haven't taken masses of pics yet, they are high quality. The battery life is superb. My previous Moto G6 needed charging by bedtime, this phone is typically running 50% charged by bedtime.WHILE THIS MAY NOT BE VERY IMPORTANT TO OTHERS, MY ONE CURRENT AREA OF MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT IS THE FACT THAT WHILE IT SUPPORTS HANDSFREE PHONE CALLS WELL WHEN BLUETOOTH CONNECTED TO MY 6 MONTH OLD BMW ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO SUPPORT HANDSFREE TEXT MESSAGING. MY 2 PREVIOUS PHONES (LUMIA 950XL AND MOTO G6) BOTH SUPPORTED HANDSFREE TEXTING WHICH WORKED GREAT AND WHICH I FIND VERY USEFUL. SO FAR, EVEN AFTER CONTACTING HUAWEI SUPPORT I CAN'T (SO FAR) GET THIS £900 PHONE TO SUPPORT HANDS FREE TEXTING.(FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE FEATURE, WHEN A TEXT ARRIVES WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING, THE CAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM (BLUETOOTH CONNECTED TO THE PHONE) NOTIFIES OF A NEW TEXT ARRIVING AND ASKS YOU IF IT SHOULD READ OUT THE TEXT. IF YOU SAY YES/OK IT READS IT OUT ALOUD. IT THEN ASKS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REPLY TO IT. IF YOU SAY 'YES' IT ASKS YOU TO DICTATE THE MESSAGE. IT THEN READS BACK THE MESSAGE AND ASKS IF YOU WISH TO SEND IT (OR DICTATE AGAIN) ... IF YOU SAY 'YES' IT SENDS IT, JOB DONE WITH NO DELAYS.)",1

5,"I was after a mobile below 6inch screen size, this one fits the bill perfectly, a huge difference from my previous Moto G5. The screen is very sharp, large internal memory and speedy, paying amazon via installments also an added bonus,",1
1,"Have had the phone for 8 months. Been ok up to now but it's suddenly developed a fault where you can't be heard on a call. The mic works, just not when you are on a call. We've googled it and this seems to be a common fault with this model and with Huawei. Unfortunately Amazon aren't interested; we have had really poor customer service. Buyer beware - check the returns policy very carefully. We will not be buying from Amazon again. One star for Amazon and Huawei. I would give them both zero if I could still leave a review.",0
5,"Despite all the recent hullabaloo over Huawei, this is a great phone for the price and excellent value. Strongly recommended.",0
4,This product was purchased for my girlfriend's sister and she loves the phone. the camera takes really good photos too.,0
5,Had the phone now three months and think it's great. Does what I need it to battery life is great and charges fast.,0
3,I bought this phone as a present for my lady friend  and as a Window phone user can only comment about it from my experience of setting it up for her. Too much Google (Acknowledge its an Android) and Google does let you have much choice  to use other apts and other browsers. I don't like Google and when I buy a new 5G phone I will choose Apple,1
5,This is the best mobile phone I have ever bought. For a new phone the battery life is phenominal and the screen quality is superb. Haven't tried the face recognition so cannot comment on that. The process of copying the files to the PC could be improved as it is not intuitive.,1
5,"Photography, once you understand the limitations and utilise the power of computational photography, the results are truly astounding. For the first time, I am using a smartphone as a real supplement to my dedicated camera system. The 'depth map' sensor is very clever!The Phone itself? it does what I would expect for the price point, with no negatives.",0
3,"The phone is good and I like the screen quality, face recognition and it takes fairly good pictures. There are no problems with the wifi however, the battery life is garbage! I don't use my phone constantly and don't really play games or music. I make a few calls per day and have about 30 text inbound/outbound/day. However, my battery is only lasting about 24 hours then the charge is down to less than 30%. I have disabled many apps only have a few running in the background so I don't understand why the battery doesn't last any longer. I contacted support and we went through all my apps, etc and disabled most of them but this made no difference battery still only lasting a day.",0
5,"I love everything about the phone, but even better was the ease of getting it to me. I had a slight problem as the phone was locked on arrival. Less tech savvy people would either have to pay extra to unlock it or send it back (for which the seller offered to do for free, so not so bad). Others, like myself, found a workaround in the security of the phone and removed the previous Google account.All in all, a great product, a great price, and active seller with good customer support. 4.8 / 5.",0
2,"Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi",1
1,"My honor 8x display is blurring and I surprise to see the video quality is like 8k to 10k rs cost mobile. I am very disappointed. I am currently using Honor 7x and it's a perfect phone. I expected the Honor 8x will keep the quality as Honor 7x. I think I received a defected phone. Anyway i have requested to replace the phone, and it's processing(after 4 days, nobody came to pickup the phone). I hope that I will get the perfect phone when it's replacing.",1
1,Camera is too bad and youtube videos quality even 1080p also not good. Colours reproduction is too bad in camera. Slow motion camera whey honor highlighted in launch event nothing in slow motion camera I am very disappointed in that section and slow motion camera is purely for pulblcity. Video department also colours not good. Battery life is average. Design and build looking like premium phone. I don't recommend this mobile to anyone. I raised a concern on twitter also but those guys are very irresponsible persons nobody is taking care about our concerns,0
1,There are tons of reviews that says what is best in the phone. So let me explain only the cons here.Camera : Portrait mode is pathetic.Display : Does not support 1080p or 780p in hotstar and amazon prime. Those who are using these apps do not buy this mobileSound : Very noisy,1
1,"Very poor network, bad sound quality,bad network quality, camera is too dull, pls amazon you are one of the good online shopping centre pls don't show faulty piece and faulty products..",0
1,It is disaster phone on 2nd day itself i was not able to hear a voice of person during calls very very very very poor call quality display is worstest i ever seen on any phone the screen gesture function is also not their i don't no what amazon has sended might be it is faulty piece bttr go for some other phone than this crap .....!!!!,0
1,Camera both front & back good only in bright light. During night it is worst than 5 MP. Sound and media volume is very low.Battery is waste.,0
1,"Poor front and rear camera result, can not stabilise picture, Bad bettery life, bad display result, colours of display also very hue, over all bad experience with this phone so dont waste 15k, go for less than 10k also notch display available in other phones.",0
3,"Mobile is totally fine if you see its overall features but there are other phones in market also who are giving at lower cost.My total complaint is for its Internet connectivity... Whenever you try to open a new Website, it loads slow and also at any transaction platform its speed loses and your payment is interrupted due to this.Many people don't observe these minor problems but I have checked its connectivity by using same sim card and configuration in other mobile but in this mobile this is really a problem.",0
1,"I am rewriting this review after 5 month usage.i am never gona purchase any honor phone again. Very bad company, at first u will like the phone but with subsequent update they will downgrade your phones qualityAnother edit after 6th month-they sell 20mp camera and after 5months forces u to use 12mp . Screenshot added",0
2,"Upgraded from Honor 6X to 8X. Good look and good performance and good battery back up so far. Display quality not so impressive. But camera is the one thing that really disappointed me, poor quality in night photography. Daylight photography also not impressive.",1
3,Slow motion video:  > it's worstCamera:  > Picture depth effect is not that clear.  > back camera at night isn't good.  > network signal strength is weak.,0
1,"Product is good in the view of camera and all the features. Dual volte is the ultimate feature.But the phone is unable to access the memory card, when you set the default storage as memory card, even if you take the 05 sec video also, phone is unable to store the data to memory card and with in seconds the device is going into blank condition.I can clearly say that, that is not the memory card problem, because the same memory card is getting good access and good functioning in other mobiles.So, after knowing this i formatted my memory card and tried take store the another video file by setting the storage as default location memory,but again it is showing the same blank condition.Disappointed due to direct storage issue",0
3,"I have moved to this model afr using oneplus one for more than 3 years. Basically the phone looks good and works decent. But the major let down is the camera. Phone doesn't have photographic touch , it just enhance the picture by the software which makes it un-realistic . Touch focus doesn't work well also they have a minimum focal distance for the the camera beyond which it will give a crisp images, lesser than that u will end up in getting blurred images. There is a difference between bokeh effect and blurred background which won't satisfy the photography enthusiast.Except camera everything is fine . So if u don't look for the mobile for best quality images then go for it. Its a good deal",1
3,"I have been using this phone for a week now and below is my review1. Screen - 9/10 (Nice vivid display, colors are sharp with lots of details)2. Battery - 9/10 (Easily lasts a day even with heavy use, if usage is medium it can last 1.5 days to 2 days)3. Call quality - 9/10 (Call reception is good)4.  Camera - 7/10 ( Camera could have been better, colors sometimes are over saturated. Night mode given is good and performs well. if you are buying phone for only camera then this phone should be avoided)5. Sound - 6/10 (Speaker are not loud. Sound quality through speaker is below average)6. Performance - 8/10 (It is fast but RAM management is not good. There is no heating issue)",0
3,Okay!! I've been using this phone for the past 1 month and I am satisfied with the performance of its ai camera battery life and screen display!! The fone is good looking and it provides a good screen to body ratio which enhance its looks!! But if u r looking for gaming purpose then I am pretty sure it's gonna disappoint you! Ive been playing pubg and pess for the last month and initially I was so happy with the performance.. But after some days I noticed the fone was having some heating issue when I was playing pubg(not top graphics) another defect I found was once my fone got hang after a continues use of 3 hrs!! I was watching a movie and as soon as I kept my fone for charging everything came to a halt and It lasted for some 10 mins!! That was something I didn't expect!! So if u r looking for a fone with good looks or good screen and good camera!! It's the best for u and at the same time if u r looking for  a gaming experience the its btr u shud try some other fone,1
1,"Touches are insensitive many a times.While playing games like PUBG or mini militia, the touches are just pathetic. Need to tap 2-3 times to get it working. Maps just don't expand or contract in one go. Randomly changes direction many a times.I received it last night and have barely used it for 6 hours as of now but it has managed to hang once (while i was using 3-4 applications only in the background...although the hand time was very small -2 seconds but still don't expect it to hang on day 1 itself)When i go to settings and try to search for a setting in the 'Search' field, the keyboard just doesn't show up. So, I can't type anything.I barely use Camera feature, but somehow feel that the Camera doesn't take good quality pictures.NO RETURN option is here. I would be happy to buy even a more expensive phone if this would be returned. For the first time, Amazon has disappointed me !",0
3,"Overall this is a nice phone in this price, but there are certain cons in it.Camera : The camera is not like you would expect with 20+2 megapixel rear & 16 megapixel front camera(1.5 out of 5)Sound : Sound system is somewhat ineffective, you should have atleast 2 speakers for such a big screen(3 out of 5)Durability : THE HONOR 8X IS VERY MUCH DELICATE, DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THE PEOPLE SHOW IN VIDEOS IN YOUTUBE, THE REALITY IS THAT MY PHONE BROKE THE VERY FIRST TIME IT FELL FROM MY HANDS, SO NEVER USE THIS PHONE WITHOUT BACK COVER, BECAUSE THE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER screen damage and I had to spend Rs. 5760 for the repairing of the screen from Honor's service center.HOPEFULLY THIS REVIEW WILL HELP YOU.",1
1,"This was my first Chinese phone, I wanted a cheap one for 1 year period. Unfortunately :1. In just 2 months the charger stopped working, another friend using different Huawei model (Honor's parent company) faced similar issue.2. Some of my apps like Google play, Financial Times, Currency, WhatsApp etc get closed automatically just 1-2 seconds after clicking.3. Headphones not included4. Music player, playlists is too basic, not even with an equalizer.5. Photos look too artificial, too bright and unnatural, like most other Chinese phones.6. Huawei's app gallery keeps buzzing with updates.This is a cheap phone, and was great initially, but not for too long.",0
3,"1. Low sound output via headphones, earphones and speaker. Lower than Redmi 6 pro.2. Not able to support Jabra Wireless head phones  (step in my case, MI phones easily do this) , so will avoid these if you use any such bluetooth audio device. [Kirin 710 supports older 4.2 bluetooth only]3.  Corner glass chipping  an issue , so case is a must as desks and pocket dust can roughen and eventually chip the glass.For people cribbing for Adreno GPU and Android One. One simple answer, the UI doesn't lag despite additional features and  if you are so tense about data security then have you ever checked the google ads section in your settings  and how it dynamically keeps on updating the ad list so that always at least 6-4 ads remain signed in?- Bless your self with security patches when you are not even sure about the completely open back door on all phones.- Chinese wechat spies but so does facebook and all other web service.",1

3,"I have purchased this mobile on Feb 4th 2019. It worked fine for two weeks, but suddenly after that, one day the OS got crashed while the mobile is kept for charging. I tried many ways to resolve, but finally after sometime I tried restarting by pressing the power button & volume button simultaneously, exactly after 10 minutes, the mobile restarted and started working normally. I don't know the cause of this crash, since I haven't installed any big apps neither any game in my mobile. But seriously honor should look into these sudden crashes and display offs. Apart from this software issue, the phone is perfect under this budget. Hope I don't see the same issue again..",0
2,The phone build quality is good and looks wise its best in the class. The worst part of this is its camera. I mean how can you say that its camera is of 20 MP and that is also with AI. The photos clicked by rear camera seems to be click by a 2mp camera. Earlier i was using mi a1 and its camera is par from honor 8X. I think honor can fix this by update. Until then i will suggest you to buy some other phone like realme 2 pro or mi note 5 pro if camera is your first priority.,1

2,I played a tech video on youtube in 1080p and when I see the text in the video which is shown in mobile is not clear and it is like blurred text even in 1080p and then I played the next video the small text is not readable and like blurred. I think it because it has low Pixels per inch (PPI) acc. to display size. And also sound quality is low as it has a single speaker but realme 2 pro has also a single speaker and it has good and loud sound than honor 8x.,0
1,Worst camera... I'm very disappointed with the camera... Camera performance of this phone is very poor... Picture quality is very low... Sound quality is not good...

3,"Fingerprint sensor is horrible. Takes too much time. No use. Camera quality is average. No worth than its price. Never go for this one. I have done a mistake.

Camera was not upto the mark and OK with that price tag.Likes: charging quickly no problem with that. Display is crispy can be viewed even on 90 degrees. Fingerprint sensor works good. No heating issues. Charge is OK for a full day use as a normal user. For heavy user 9hrs may be. You can go for it.",0

Often the pictures taken  are very very  unrealistic . Sees like the AI function is pathetic. EIS is a definite miss. Slow motion camera is also a failure. Can’t recognize the  moving objects clearly . Video play back is also not that good. YouTube videos in fully screen  lacks clarity.  A number of time the  Camera setting were  changed to default.  But of no use.,  Hope the company may  rollout few updates to rectify these basic issues.",0

3,Hi Friends.Mobile looking very Nice.Picture Quality.Display resolution also very well.Ram Management also... OK. (NOT great)User Interface is Good.Average Battery Life.Camera.I expected more than Mi A1. But Honor 8x giving a below average pictures.. Only 2x Zoom is there but if u zoom 2x there  blur in picture. Specifications shows 20mp + 2mp but this mobile performance is like below 10 mp single camera. If you are a camera Lover better don't buy this.Sound QualityVery Low out put.Better think twice before purchase.,0
3,"Very pathetic battery life. Hardly runs for 12 hrs with moderate usage.On top of that this phone has super efficient memory management it doesn't even keep an app in background for even 1 second .like you switch between apps and you lost the state in old app , and have to start from all over again.With such super efficient battery management it should have be giving more battery backup but it looks like to be working against it.",0
3,"I was surprised by the packing and got confused if this is new or refurbished,Then checked it on the youtube they all are getting the same packing. It is sealed pack with one sticker not packed with the polythene.And the phone inside was also in a thing which I did not expected.So do not get confused by the packing.Performance is something I cannot say a word about.It is that good.Looks is decent.Go with the black one as blue one is looking odd as it is black from front.Display is good enoughCamera does not have any image stabelization so for clicking best pic from it you need to be steady well.Other wise camera is good enoughNight mode is not that good.Did not try the slow motion.Battery is good enough but charges slow.Expected a lot by the reviews but got disappointed.SO DO NOT EXPECT MORE",1

3,"For 15k the phone is a great deal, with 6.5 inches screen, 20MP+2MP rear camera and a 16MP front camera along with a 3750mAH battery, it's a total package. But what is the use of such great specs with not so great performance? The camera works fine under daylight situations only with the AI mode enabled and during the night it shoots pictures like an 8MP camera. Next, the speaker is something which I didn't expect, it literally plays 320kbps song as if it is playing a low-quality audio file. The battery output of this is good, and the display is vivid and bright for streaming. It is a huge package with limited functionalities. If you are looking for a budget phone with mediocre necessities then ""This is It!""",0

1,"It is unfortunate that this kind of product is being sold on Amazon. Innocent customers like me are trapped by lucrative offers only to discover later that it lacks basic features to run it in a different country like US. India should ban this product and so should Amazon. I would request full refund on this product as it does not meet basic requirement of a mobile device. Nowhere in the sales document did they mention in clear visible font that HONOR 8 X doesn't work in some countries like USA. Amazon should also look into such spurious products being sold on its platform. We customers trust Amazon...but in case of any breach, this can lead to negative feedback about Amazon",0

1,The phone started problem in signal on the next day of arrival itself. Amazon agent had tested using their own application online and the test had failed. So they said the phine will get replaced. But I was forced to return the mobile before getting new one as they had no hand to hand pickup. It's getting 4 days I am sitting without a mobile and I have not received any pickup delivery agent message yet even though the new product has reached the near by station.

""Only 4G"" network selection is not available. Back cover provided is very poor material.. It got yellow in 10 days that gives a cheap look to the phone. Without back cover phone is very slippery... In PUBG the navigation button always creates problem.. Many of times i got killed bcoz of this. When i play it on my 2.5 years old Oppo F1s that gives smother play than this. I won't recommend this phone. Biggest cons is it is very heavy n Bulky.Update-Very poor toughness of screen. I have Oppo F1s 2.5 years old still no crack in screen but in this 8X it got small crack by keeping it in pocket only.",0

Very slow charging time, even with the 18w charger from another phone. No quick charge, no nothing.2. Terrible software. Slower than any phone i have used so far and each update make it worst. Bluetooth is terrible to connect, looses connection every 5 mins. Have to reconnect every now and then, and it doesn't connect at all sometimes3. Poor camera. In daylight its fine, at par with lower end phones, but low light performance if really poor. Night mode takes good pics of places but not of people. Video is shaky and poor.4. Loudspeaker is crap.5. Sound through audio jack is even crappier.6. Phone is very fragile, dropped it from almost 2 feet and screen shattered. Had to get it repaired. Case included in box is cheap and don't protect the phone well7. Face detection is slow, and doesn't work in dark areasAs a secondary phone it's about ok, but don't buy this phone as your primary phone. It should be around 8-9k given all the issues with the phone there are. Other phone I had before it as my secondary device was MOTO G5S Plus. A much much better phone than this Honor crap",1
3,Pros : Battery life okay.  RAM and storage worth.Cons:  Camera quality not good as per expectation.  You cant use dual sim whenever memory card inserted.one Sim + memory card pattern,0
1,"Worst camere and low sound let's this device down which is the major requirement of all the phone lovers.No fast charging. Need to wait for more den 2 hrs for complete charge.No 4k video recording. Pictures taken luks like artificial. If u take pic of green color the pik output will be of blue colour which is totally worst.If u give max volume also the sound will be too low.Portrait mode aperture mode and normal photo mode all looks similar, no difference at all.",0
1,"Guys!! I am  using this mobile form last 5 days, phone is very good in terms of camera, battery and daily apps usage.One thing is quite frustrating is it plays adds as soon as you disconnect the call and that too in a loud sound.if you are attending a meeting and you finish a call on your mobile and then it starts playing some video in a loud sound and asks you to install the app. You will feel ashamed in front of audience. Please beware before you buy this phone. It is happening in huawei,honor and redmi phones.",0
3,"So i ordered this phone was very exited and when i actually got it in hand and checked the camera and battery they are not as they tell you. Camera is 20MP as they say but i compared it with my old phone Mi note 4 with 13 MP camera and result were same, burryness in 8x is bad. Dont fall for youtube reviews they dont zoom the pictures but when you capure the image and zoom it the blur is like old keypaid phone. Also UI is not good, looks cheap. Go with other phone if youre looking for good camera, but look of this phone is good.",0
1,No video call...Disappointed...Phone is very delicate. Screen broken in just one drop from two feet height.,0
1,"It's been 9days from the time I have purchased this phone and it stopped working at all. I was scrolling through Google news one and it aksed ""tap for update"", which usually any android phone with Google news, does. I just tapped on the same and it just got off. Completely shut. This is ridiculous. Never expected from Honor. After using Honor 4X for more than 4yrs I trusted X version and purchased it. Now tell me what should I do?",0

2,"Bought this phone on 20-Jan-2019. Initially it connected to wifi. After initial installations and updates, I was using mobile data. Today when I tried to enable wifi, I could not. I did a factory reset, but still I am not able to enable wifi or blue tooth. It has 12 month warranty. I am not sure if the company will now replace the product or it will fix it and how much time it is going to take. I have to now initiate the complaint.Noticed battery also drains fast. The SIM tray seems to be low quality. The wifi problem indicates that the parts inside is of low quality. Only the outside shape and finish is good.",0
2,Mobile look like a premium one.EMUI interface is very user friendly. Camera performance is average. It doesn't have any gorilla glass protection. After updating to pie battery is draining fast. It is not at all compactible on hand. Within 6 months it self my glass got broken. Overall we cannot say that it's midrange phone.,0
2,"cant hear my alarm go off a single day the sound is so low. Camera wise MiA2 is better. Battery is good. I really regret buying this phone. Amazingly it has got so many great reviews out here that I got misled. Bad camera, Bad speakers, even poor connectivity.Really regret buying it.",0
3,Bought yesterday.. Kept charging for 2 hrs.. Software Updated to emui 2.0.. Hoped for better battery hrs with honor.. But disappointed with battery as it drains fast.. Within 30 min it drains from 100 to 80% even in standby mode..,0
1,"Internet connectivity very lowhangs everytimeu cant even update 5-6 whatsapp status at one time... it hangs like hellheat while playing gamemost stupid phone i have ever usedUsed Sony, Samsung, Redmi, Motorola, Lava, Oppo, Vivobut Honor is seriously third class among them all",1
1,"Very Big deal breaker point is you can't direct video call, I can't believe that. Havent clone all app. This saimfull for honor",0
3,"I am using this phone about 4 days now Screen Quality Is Very Good Sound Through Earpiece is AwesomeFOR PLAYING PUBG  Gaming phone is great not heating issue you can play on HD Settings with minor lags or frame drops PLUS GREAT BATTERY BACKUP you can play pubg 6-7 hours with full 100% chargeCons:Touch screen is sometime not working properlyCamera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loud, The loudspeaker quality is AwfullVibration is very lowThere is slight lag when switching between apps",0

2,"Disturbance in Audio and video internet call, Even when you are calling direct phone to phone by using mobile network. The other side peoples cannot listen my voice properly. it is very low and sometime suddenly it becomes normal. Sound issue in the device.",0
1,I can't believe my eyes when I saw 1-2 secs lag in my each touch on screen on such a powerful phone! Now making call on my phone is  a nightmare.. take dialler[ 2 secs ] >>  load contacts [ 1 sec ] >> search contacts [ 1 sec ] >> make  a call [ 2 sec ]..so 6 secs lag  to make a call..may times I end up dialing wrong contact because the scroll-select is amazingly slow and after 2-3 secs it'll dial the wrong contact...the same lag I am feeling in many places...I am surprised to see that none else has reported this....anyway highly disappointed!,0
3,I didn't like the battery back-up timing. Battery drains very fast even in power saving mode. Camera quality is sort of average I would say. User interface misses out too many features in comparison to Xiomi phones in the same price range. You won't like the media consumption without any headset as the sound level is very low in this phone. Ringtone volume is too less that you can't listen while ridding. Except these phone is good for day-to-day use,0
1,Liked the sharp and bright colour display.But didn't like:Call performanceGaming performanceRam managementOverall a disaster mobile for gamers and cameramen. When call comes to this mobile and when i go to receive the mobile gets stuck. When i play a normal game (note not high ram and frame rated game like pubg or asphalt) it gets stuck. Actually the screen turns i.e totally black.Low light photography is poor.Thus its not worth to pay 19k for this mobile.,0
3,"I'd request the buyers... Do not opt for this phone... Look wise it's really gud but as a product Nah. I've received this phone on 2nd Jan, 2019 n today it's 16th Jan, 2019.m facing a lot of problem with this. While using this phone it is automatically getting switched off n on, it gets hanged for a longer period n if u want to switch it off during that dat period even the power button also doesn't work. Even the battery is also not doing well... Frankly not happy with this phone😑",0
3,"Screen durability is very bad & sensitive.so many reviews shows that screen durability is very high with gorilla glass, but It is broken even it fallen from 3ft height.& amazon also promised that, they will give screen replacement upto 6months after bought the handset(they said that, replacement guarantee will receive as a mail) ,I didn't get till now...",0

2,If u don't care about the camera performance..It won't let u down on any other segments..Camera is worst honor 6x is better in camera..PUBG hangs..Excellent battery,0
3,"Honor 8x looks very good, has very good battery life..but the camera quality is very worst.for spending RS 15,000 this product gives a very cheap quality camera, the spec says 20 megapixel...my god it seems it has only 2 mp camera I would give only zero for camera. Plssssss u can purchase other good mobile..like note 5 pro or mi a2 for this price.",1
3,"The Honor X franchise seems to be good, though have used 6X, 7X and Now 8X, But I am not very satisfied by 8X's camera and video quality. The company needs to work on camera quality a lot. Sometimes 7X Camera seems to be better.",1
1,Honor 8X has very few frequency band and it doesn't work internationally. If you planning to use this phone while roaming or on vacation outside india then don't buy it. Camera has oversaturated photos and speaker is very low quality.,0
1,I really had high hopes for the kirin 710 processor and the mali g51 gpu but i was wrong...i am a very hardcore cell phone user and accordings to reviews and the performance of which the kirin 710 was capable was all a lie ....cant even open another app with closing a earlier one if i am playing a game....this is the first and last time i bought a cell phone with kirin and ARM cpu and gpu on board.,0

3,"Massive hd display with minimal borders, good built quality, premium glass body feels very premium and slim in hand,camera is amazing u can take good quality photos,external speaker is loud little bit distortion but in earphones the quality is not up to the mark its of average quality, And very sad to say you cannot make video calls directly from dialler.. I m dissatisfied that a 15k phone from honor doesn't have a video calling feature.",0
3,Camera is not that good. Artificial decorations felt in the photo means photo does not look natural. After zooming in the picture pixels appear to be blurred and picture isn't clear.Home key is placed just below the space key. We press space but back button is pressed instead and user is taken back to previous page or home screen. After changing the keypad gesture the problem doesn't go away.,0
1,"Food for thought for anyone looking to purchase a Huawei handset (especially the amazing P30): the US Government's ban on Huawei means Google can no longer provide Android OS updates to Huawei handsets - this is effect immediately. For our staff this means their Huawei handsets that currently work with MDM may stop working correctly, or stop working altogether in the near future.

Build quality is satisfying.Amazon is playing games with EMI scheme. I was charged more than what was shown at the time of checkout. If Amazon can show courtesy I would like initiate refund process.,0
3,"The design is awesome, so is the battery.. Performance and display are good... Little frame drops while playing pubg which was the same experience when I was using snapdragon 625...Camera is below average and hence a 3 star rating.. I don't know the browns turn orangey even with the AI mode off.. And the selfies are quite pinky for my liking even with the beauty mode off...

1,The phone is not having a native video calling option and this is not mentioned in item description and it claims to support  VoLTE. Very much disappointed with Amazon's return policy.

1,i dropped the phone in water.it went off that instant. the service care people did not even touch it and declared it to be permanently dead. all those youtube videos regarding liquid test were proven wrong.

If u are looking for camera quality, Asus zenfone max pro 2  will be a good option within this range. Also Honor 8x has a problem with fingerprint sensor.. doesn't  work most of the time.",1
3,The sound is pathetic. Picture quality is below standard and the battery life is acceptable.. Over all not at all happy with the device,0

So please tell me what i can do now. If i can't use my phone as a smart phone or for a multi tasking. Why i buy this phone.",0
3,"its camera is not good at all. if you looking for camera , don't buy. screen is also not good, pics are appearing over coloured and blackish.other things battery, performance, memory management, durability, music, all are good.but sometimes touch is not responding great.",0
1,I buy new Honor 8X on November. After use of one month I found some issues in display. I found some black line in my mobile display.

3,The screen glass is very low quality.because it put down from only 1 feet hight appox and then the sceen has broke. Do not buy. I am suffering.

1,"A device packed with glossing style and snappy UI. Though Sound output and front camera quality is a big let down. No ""Native video calling"" is another compromise. Choice is yours: if you are craving for outer looks then go for it else there are plenty of other options",0
2,"Dear Team,I placed an order for honour 8x which got delivered ,but the back case which I received along with box is not compatible with mobile. Back case is different and small in size,kindly find attached snapshots.Aap check karke nai bejte hai kya back cover. Very disappointed.",0

3,The two main fault of this phone is bad ram management and very bad camera quality. In this segment you have a better option. If you want a better styling looking phone the honor 8x is best. It's look a premium quality phone,1
3,Sound of the phone is quite inferior than other phones in the segment. My lumia 535 gives a better output. Not sure if Huawei will give an update. I would have liked to give a negative mark to it but it has just got stars in the review for sound.,0

Hope this tyme I got lucky.By researching the user experiences I can guess that Honor's manufacturing unit is not that great because No user have similar problems, they all have different issues either camera, battery, ram or sound.Bdw, i am facing all of them except camera.1) out of 4GB RAM initially you only get around 2GB.2) device is not as fast as I thought. little bit of slow, mostly during data transfer or sharing of files3) most of the Honor 8X users mentioned that It takes around 2hrs to be fully charged but in my case It takes around 1hr.4) while charging it heats up little, near camera5) Speaker Sound is not that loud, I practically found it was not loud enough in a noisy area6) RAM management is just ok7) Earpiece Sound is loud but at maximum or near maximum sound level it deteriorates its quality. generally YOu won't need maximum level.8) back glass don't have oleo phobic coating so, easily catches fingerprints.9) Battery drains fast. can't say it is 3750mah or not......will update later if I find something else.",0

No lag while gaming...played pubg and pes for a long time. Kirin 710 did a good job. Camera quality performs well at outdoor lighting conditions.Cons: Sound amplification is not loudFront camera flash missingNo fast charging,0
5,"Using Honor 8X since last 80 Hours and True observations are as follows -(1) A glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium(2) impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin(3) Awesome Camera quality both front and back camera in day and night light,The Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities.(4) Look and feel wise its best it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC.(5) No Heating problems at all used heavy games and concurrent loaded applications (as a part of load testing)As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimization that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games.(6) A 3750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) chargingCons - The UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful.",1
4,"Well this is my first Honor phone .Delivery was very fast , it was supposed to come on Sunday but it came on Friday so I am very happy with such service .Now I am writing review after using it for 2 days , I will keep updating this comment after some use of mobile .Body :After opening the packet the first impression was WOW !!! the glass back body looks really elagant and beautiful simultaneously .The front screen amazes you with good screen to body ratio. Usually I hate phones with  large brezel border on bottom but this phone has a very small or u can say neglible brezel.Preloaded Apps :The pre-installed apps are very less only Google package takes most of the space in pre installed package.Camera : The camera is great and AI   is successfully remastering photos with more vivid and vibrant colour  . There is slow Mo modes , potrati with Bokeh etc .Processing : I played some giant games like pubg , spider man 2 and PES , and I never felt like that it is lagging so it is a good sign that Kirin is doing some work behind the scenes .Heating : I have observed some heating problem but its minute and don't be a bother for me .Google Lens : the Google assistant comes with Google Lens which is pretty good .Battery : Well I think that battery is draining a little bit faster than my old phone , I think may be I need to tweak some settings to get the best out of the battery .",1

But no, it was light weight.I turned it around and the dual finish was awesome.Two camera looked like eyes of Minions :DNext I turned on the display and I see that blue light from one end to other. That was massively huge and bezels were almost not there.I've always loved the way PhoneClone takes the backup from other phone. Honor FTW for this.Moving in to the system and first thing I checked was the camera. Loved the clarity of the pic and accuracy of the Bokeh was good. What I love about dual-camera in honor is that I can fix aperture after the click.As it has been just a day so cant say much about battery but all in all REALLY LOVING THIS FOR NOW...",0

People will admire it or at least notice it no matter where you are!",1
5,Have been using this mobile from past 1 week and honestly speaking I had too much confusion in my mind regarding this handset as most of the handset comparisons I read or watched said that the camera of the mobile is not up to the mark. I was totally confused between realme 2 pro and this one. But eventually I made my decision to go with this handset and it turned out to be a  right decision .Everything is so perfect in this handset plus looks of this handset is totally awesome. This is my second honor phone. First one was honor 9 lite.... and both of them are super.Happy purchasing :)PS: All those who are complaining about a camera are probably looking for a quality of 50k handset in 15k. Also camera should not be the only deciding factor when looking for a suitable handset. Performance of the device in other areas should also be valued and Honor NEVER dissapoints .,0
5,"Had written a awesome review about this phone earlier.... The earlier one got stolen and reordered the same model, surprisingly the one I ordered now does not perform the same as the earlier one given on launch.When checked the boxes... The ones given at launch were China Made and one given now is India made.... I am not against make in India... But the processor definitely has some issues. I am tired of waiting for everything to load and checking for wats app messages....",0
4,"I have been a Mi user. ( Previous phones - Mi3, Redmi 4 , Redmi 6 ). However, owing to ads issue & dull look, decided to try a new brand. Of Realme, Oppo,Vivo, I went for Honor 8x)This is my 2nd Honor 8X purchase.(1st one for my brother & 2nd one for myself). Happy with its performance & premium look. From the price to feature comparison, I have no complaints.I am an average user ( e.g. Calls, mails,whatsapp with casual gaming.) The battery life is good for a day.With minor irritants which I have experience  in both the phones (Hope it gets resolved in future updates)1. Audio from earphones is below average2. Apps do not close. e.g. Gaana ,Amazon music app continue to play even after closing them.3. Bluetooth range is below average & connection is not stable4. No EIS/OIS provided .Hope if they can provide through software updateIn terms of MIUI v10 vs  EMUI v8.2, I feel MIUI provides more nifty features which I really miss in Honor 8x.Irrespective, I am satisfied with the Phone",0
4,I had buy this phone after lot of research & consider to buy since not other phone match this specs at this range...I had ordered it on the launch Day itself & using it with last 12 Days & found very satisfied with it....Pros...1. Good look2. Notch display3. Display Quality4. Power saving modes for long Battery backup.5. Selfie camera.Cons..1. Rear camera not showing the real things enhance more than actual colour variation can easily be noticed.2. Lag some time & feel hanged at 3-4 times in just 10 Days normal use no gaming etc..Conclusion: Overall Good package at with this specs & price range..Look is awesome,0
5,Honor 8x looks is awesome but its camera not bad but not good its battery is excellent you can play pubg in hd never lack ...And charging time not more only 2 hours get full at first 1 to 70 % charge 1% in one minute that is awesome... I have only issue in this smartphone that is only camera i gave only 3/5.But it is batter than any other smartphone under 18kIts looks wooooow......you can buy with freely minds honor gave you update in camera than its awesomeAnd its camera pixels is good ...but with AI mode in day light camera gave excellent pics 😘😘😘,0

5,Honor has already a best quality forever. Phone is very fast and smooth. Display is very impressive. Sound quality is amazing in speakers and earphones too because of HUAWEI HISTEN sound technology. Camera works pretty well and captures great and fantastic photos. In low light condition camera works very good. Display is sharp and this massive 6.5 inch device is best for multimedia and gaming. Hisilicon kirin 710 is very fast. Battery backup is too good. Redmi note 5 pro and Realme 2 pro is nothing in front of Honor 8x. In reality Honor 8x is a real pro.,1
4,Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days,0
5,The phone is just fantastic.Ordered on the launch day midnight and received on the next day. Kudos to amazon for fast delivery.PROS:(1) DISPLAY: The display is very vibrant and of good quality. The display size is big but for eyes not for your hands or pockets. 10/10(2) DESIGN: We all know about this so no comment.10/10(3) CAMERA: The pics are very sharp and close to reality. Night mode is awesome. 9/10(4) BATTERY: The battery is powerful and it will be more powerful if used with AIRTEL sim. I have watched 2 movies on  YouTube and still 68% juice left. Taken about 117 minutes to charge from 10 to 100%(5) NO LAGS: I don't feel any type of lags while using it. Gaming persons can tell about this.(6) SECURITY: Face unlock and fingerprint scanner works like a charm. No need to press power button for face unlock.CONS:STILL FINDINGEXPECTATIONS FROM HONOR:(1) Please provide EIS in the updates so that camera will work with its full capacity.(2) If possible please provide fast charging.,0
4,I have this phn(4/64 version). Overall performance is good. Camera is decent at this price point. But the speaker's quality is too bad. Even after full volume  the speaker's sound is too low which really disappoint me. Otherwise the device is really good.,0
5,Very nice picture quality,0
5,really awesome phone camera battery life really good gaming also,0
4,The performance of the phone is amazing! Too fast and the applications work so perfectly and no hanging problem. The fingerprint sensor is quite fast. The color pixels and camera quality is perfect! Got the phone at a very good price during sale.,0
5,Nice product,0
5,"Everything is perfect on this device but Camera is not good it does't have 20 and 16 megapixel, both front and back have only 2mp camera , please honor fix it in your nest update...",0
5,"Honor 8 X Design differentiates itself from others in this Price Segment, It is of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, However it is recommended to use the soft TPU case which is bundled in the box to avoid scratches. Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin with 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around. Even though the Screen is 6.5 inch this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm.The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy and is quiet fast, Not only does this phone look good, it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, However the Google Messages App which is bundled is not as user friendly and also not that fast in response. Would definitely recommend the Mobile at this Price Point, It is Value For Money.",0
5,"Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x",0
5,"This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor",1
5,"What a magnificent phone it is.!!1.The battery life is awesome. With a morerate usage, the battery easily goes for 1 and half days of battery life.2.Camera quality is awesome. The pics taken with aperture mode and night modes are brilliant.3.There are no lags and heating issues as of now.4. Initially i was bit skeptical about the phone. However after a usgae of 14 days i ak pretty sure that i have made the correct choice by not going with Realme2 pro or Redmi Note 5 pro.The only take away is the OS EMUI which needs improvement in some areas so as to enable more smooth experience for users.",1
4,Camera alone has cons other than that everything is good.,0
5,the most Important thing to note that Honor has done a spectacular job in the design area for this device...its not too heavy or big or anything...the notch is lovely ❤️display quality is excellent though one can tweek it as they want...cameras are great aspect of this device (though i saw in some of the reviews that people were complaining about it) well if one know how to go around with snaps and imagegraphy they can produce some beautiful shots ❤️gaming is also priority for some peoples so don't worry much this can easily handle PUBG or Asphalt 9 easily...you won't notice any heating or lagging while playing the aforementioned games !battery life was a thing for which i was afraid of but it didn't disappointed me any point...the stats were always good and showed that Kirin 710 is actually a great chipset choice ⭐one more thing in the price point they have done a spectacular job ⭐,0
5,I just got it 3hours back.. And guess what the look of the mobile is extremely premium. And the build quality is awesome. Camera is quite good. This is my first review for this mobile. I will give more reviews after 3days,0
4,I bought this device on release date itself im loving it i just want to say cons bcoz it has lot of prosCons: rear camera should improve a little bit it produces over saturation images and their is no eis i hope they will fix that via ota update,0
5,"Buy just 2 days before, it's experience is just wow with AI Camera feature and big battery life and also at amazing price under diwali sale😊. Very good to buy a honor mobile again lastly I used Honor Holly which was also durable and does well with regard to time, Wanna to stick with Honor for future also👍👍",0
4,After reading a lot of reviews I will try my best to clear many confusion which I myself have before purchasingDisplay - very beautiful... I have used super amoled before so I was doubt full about it but it's really goodBuilt - amazingBattery life - very good no heating issue no fast battery drain even charger is fast trust me.. In 20 min phone goes from 56 to 88.User interface -  I was using stock android so was pretty confused about it but it's not much different and I didn't find any problem using it.Speed - I am not a heavy user for everyday s tasks net surfing it's really fastSound - speakers are pretty good didn't find any problem during call or even listening music even I found it loud and clearCamera - this is the most criticised part of honors 8x I used it and my verdict isRear camera - thumbs up.. Portrait mode - OK ok type some time objects edges get blurredNight mode - worstSlow motion - worst it just record 10 seconds video that too very blurFront camera - it's just ordinary typeOverall I will say camera is good not  bad at this price range and rear camera is good.. pictures are clear and crisp.. So if you're not much into photography camera wont be a problem as in my case. Even overall camera performance is goodOverall it's really a nice phone at this price..After 1 week I will review again because it's too early to make an opinion about it,1
5,"Writing review after 7 days of usage:PROS:1)Beautiful design, almost no bezels2)Sharp and crispy display, Great viewing  angles3)Powerful kirin 710 with GPU TURBO(no  lag)4)3750 polymer battery, almost lasts for  more than a day with mix usage5) Camera quality is much higher than  expectations  Daylight conditions 9/10  Night conditions 8/10CONS:1) Fast charging is missing(but if you use fast chargers of other well-known brands then it will charge from 10%-100% in 90-100minutes.)2) EISTHAT'S IT!!!I got this beast for 13.5kworth every penny",0
4,"Very good phone in this price range with huge disply, no heating problem at all. Nice front camera, avg rear camera. First appreciation for darsitha electronics for fast and safe delivery..

4,"Bought Honor 8X 4GB/64GB Variety for my office Staff and giving this review after using this phone.I got this phone at 13100 after applying Bank Cashback and No Cost EMI Cashback of 458, so Kudos to Amazon Great India Sales.Now coming up on the user experience after use:PROS:1. Design is Superb and feel good in Hand. The Glossy dual-Tone Glass Back look gives Visual Grating Effect.2. TPU Back Cover and Pre-Installed basic screen cover makes this Phone as Ready To Use condition.3. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock work flawlessly and gives faster opening without lag.4. DUAL Sim+Dedicated Micro SD card Slot for adding more GB and extra storage to this device as per the need and usage.5. Dedicated Headphone jack is another good option is available in this phone.6. Moderate multitasking experience.7. Screen Size 6.6 Inch with 1080x2340 provides crisp and clear screen.8. 3750 mAh battery last long and gives more than 1 Day of battery life in normal usages.9. 16MP frond Camera gives crisp and clear images with detailing and depth effect.CONS:1. Back camera is not upto the mark and image quality is also not good, gives some un-natural colour looks like used 3rd Party App for image enhancement. so back camera sucks.2. I personally don't like the default keyboard as it's has many options in one keys which create a lot of confusion while typing and messaging.3. Night Mode camera is also not useful and images are very un-natural and less detailing.4. Portrait Mode, Aperture Mode is Pathetic.5. No Fast Charging and Micro USB port.Final Verdict.Yes Indeed it's a very effordable mid range smart phone with lots of features under camera and other many user features available in this phone. Some issues with the camera images but otherwise it is a good phone with lot many features which we needed in our day to day usages. But if you have some more budget then you can try some other handset available between 20K-30K.",0
5,This phone has excellent features but fails in the audio department. Missing my exchanged Lenovo K4 Note with Dolby Atmos & stereo speakers...,1
5,"Have been using from 2 days intensively. Here are my pros and cons:Pros & cons:Display: Suberb display. Great color accuracy. Sunlight legibility is good. Black levels are excellent. Almost bezel less looks simply amazing. I think it has gorilla glass 3 protection on the front. Screen guard comes pre applied.Build Quality: Amazing build quality. Front & back glass with a aluminium frame, phone looks premium.Sound: External sound is slightly on the dimmer side. Sound from the headphones are pretty good.Camera: Don't know why people are complaining about the camera. I found it to be excellent for the price. AI works pretty well. Both rear and front cams take good pictures. Although this is a mobile phone camera so don't expect Dslr quality.Software: UI is buttery smooth. Many useful features. Loads of themes and customization options. Happy with the UI. Only concern is Honor's software updates. Its still on September 2018 security patch. Ram management is Ok.Battery: Battery endurance is good. Can do a full day marathon. 4G connectivity eats battery fast. Rest for all other functions the battery does a good job.Packing: This is where I am not happy with the seller. The phone box was simply wrapped inside a air bubble cover. They could have provided another carton box to keep the mobile box. My mobile box has taken some good beatings. Lucky that the phone was safe.I am happy with the purchase. The phone does the job well and it is a good buy at 15,000/-. I exchanged my Redmi Note 5 pro for this and I believe I made the right decision. Although no type C connector, but not a big deal for me.",0
5,1. Big 6.5' screen2. Good screen quality and resolution3. Great battery life almost a day for moderate use4. No lag what so ever5. Both Cameras are good even in low light condition.,0
4,"Pros:1.  Build quality is looking to be premium (feels premium)2.  EMUI is good, has got lot of features (minimizing the screen size, good themes, battery manager, etc)3.  Battery life is good and last for about 1 day (for about 4-6 hours video streaming intermittently) - not tested fully, but seems to be good for 6.5 inch screen.4.  Camera performance is very good under good lighting conditions (outdoor and indoor with good light settings).5. Back transparent cover coming in the box.cons:1.  takes about 2.30 - 2.45 hours to charge fully. (no fast charging)2.  Slow motion is just for 10 seconds and that too not pretty good with normal light settings (has lots of noises)3.  Indoor picture with normal lighting is enhanced unnecessarily, (not sure if it can be turned off of something), looks artificial at times.4.  Would be great if the Tempered glass is also provided in the box.My take: This is a very good phone for 17k (i have 6 GB ram phone), which you can buy.",0
5,"Ok, first of all i will say that'No combination of 26 alphabeted can describe this phone, it is so good'After 2 months of experience - -😅 I defeated a mobile with 4000mah battery in battery test easily as it has 12 nm piwerful chipset ehich consumes less power with a greater efficoency!!😅Took a lots of cool, crystal clear, punch and vibrant photoes😅Done a lot of innovative things with it futerist camera😅Impressed my friends with the slo-mo vedios😅Played PUBG on Hd graphics with High frame rate, very very smoothly which made me the best player in my colony!!🤔But deleted PUBG now, Think a little Broader?

4," The look and design of the phone is good, you will love it in first watch.What is good with this phone:1. The back look is awesome, it is mirror effect.2. You will also get a good quality silicon backcover free and a usb charger.3. Music and sound is OK not very good. If you use a branded earphone you may get good sound quality, i am using sony headphones and getting a good quality sound.5. Touch is good and smooth.What is Missing in this Phone:1. No conference call.2. Night mode camera is not good3. Picture quality is not so good. for those who do not want high resolution pictures is ok, bokeh effect is not so impressive.",0
4,I am using this phone currentlyI feel very luckyAmazing camera qualityAmazing appearanceNice colorsWonderful battery backupAnd lots of amazing things....I loved it,0
4,The phone's design is very good the glass body look alike at the back and the sleek notch in the front makes it look attractive particularly in the blue colour. Phone is a charm when used moderately I mean day to day activities like social media shopping apps games calls etc. The downfall of the product is the speaker. Its very low. Even the audio jack output is low. I tried using some third party apps to enhance the quality but doesn't work. The update for software is also slow. Its been a month since huwaei has rolled out the pie update but still i haven't recieved any notification. Camera is kinda good in artificial lighting.. Night mode works decent. Battery is good enough to take through one whole day with above average usage. Heavy gamers may find the battery draining at almost at the end of the day where it needs to charge up again. Overall the phone is good and processor is quite good too phone doesn't hang up...,0
5,"I have been using this phone since +1 day from launch date.To keep thing short I will not dwell upon configurations and how good it is. Rather focusing on points which was fond while using.Camera function is impressive. At first picture were over saturated with and without AI mode, now it is fixed with software update .The display is hugh thanks to tiny bezels looks very premium simetrical with notch turned off.Battery is good for a days use with 2hrs of youtube and 1hr of gaming.Ui is good comes with a lot of Chinese blotware but those can be uninstalled. However be careful with uninstalling as some software are actually good and will be lost  as they are available in play store.",0
5,"After using 2 day i found honor done a great work with their honor 8x phone.When you hold the phone it feel like premium phone in 15k price point.Everyone told about  it's  sound problem, but i want told them that you guys use phone like home theater? Guys believe  me honor 8x have good earphones  as well as main speaker. Guys believe go for this device.",0
5,"Honor 8x what a great quality phone having 6.5 inch crystal clear display with hd+ and fhd+ settings, The screen to body ratio is very well mentained and the finishing gives a premium reach feel to user..Sound quality is very good with huawei histen audio on headphones and on speaker very well loud enough.Battery is very good performed even it has 6.5 inch display, Huawei CPU Turbo works awesome.Performance of software and hardware is like Flagship phone., I am Redmi and samsung user previously and i can say this phone is a better performing in terms of Cpu and battery.Pub g and you tube video experience is really awesome and i like the screen body ratio because of full scren tab setting given in phone.I am very happy choosing this phone under 20k this phone is must buy and i dont thik the uniquness of this phone any other phone will provide in this android market.",1

Applications load fast too.If you like punchy, vibrant colours in your photos, you will love the camera.If you like natural colours in your photos, you may not like the camera.The night mode is awesome and useful.Honor 8X is the first phone ever with a certified eye comfort mode. I use blue light filter all the time and it does not strain your eyes.The phone is lighter than the Redmi Note 5 Pro and does not feel huge and bulky.It feels very premium to hold Honor 8X and you and your friends will be amazed to see the shiny reflective back.This phone has raise to wake feature. So if you pick up your phone, your phone will unlock within 1 second. You don't even need to press the power button. I bet you will use the fingerprint scanner in dark only.Also you can answer a call by raising your phone to your ear. You don't need to press or swipe the green answer call buttonPeople having small hands and small fingers may face problems using the phone with one hand.Super Slow motion at 480fps is greatOverall it is a good, innovative and futuristic phone and it is one of the best smartphone under ₹15000.If you did not find Realme 2 Pro good and interesting, you should go for Honor 8X",1
5,"Overall a premium looking phone. Decent camera quality, great vivid display, awesome battery life.. many people's wont tell you but this phone has a great battery backup.. i am a hardcore gamer as well as a office person.. often I play pubg.. clash royale and asphalt 9 legends and from 9 morning to make evening 7 i still go 10-15% juice left. Only the problem is audio quality via headphone or speaker. Even my moto G2 gave me better sound quality than this one but in 15k u wont ask for much.Happy to buy this one.Thanks Huawei.Thanks Amazon for fast shipping.",1
5,"Its been 3 months now since I have been using this phone so here is my review of the phone.The box contains the main unit, sim ejector pin, a 2A Huwaei charger, an standard usb cable, a silicon cover and some user manuals.The phone feels premium in hand. The glossy glass at the back looks stunning. I have the blue variant and it is gorgeous to look at. The silicon cover adds protection to the phone but it gets yellowish over time. The phone is very smooth to use out of the box and the 4gb ram feels sufficient to do multitasking, although I do not keep any activity in the background. I play PUBG at times, the phone doesn't heat up and the battery drain is acceptable. The battery life is great, with standard use of facebook and instagram I get a backup of 1 and half day. The charging speed is good too. The screen is big and vibrant and viewing angles are great. The screen has a plastic film pre installed for protection and it has been serving me well. The camera could have been better but I guess future updates will improve that too. The AI mode in camera gives vibrant photos and there are a lot other options to play with too. Overall, its a great phone from Huwaei untill Huwaei disappoints us with software updates.",0

I have been using OnePlus 5T and Camera is superb on 5T.Con:When I used Honor 8x Camera, it did not convince me its configuration. It is not good. Color saturation is on higher end. Every picture would look punchy in color and unnatural.Videos are unstable. Low light pictures are pathetic.If you're considering camera phone with under 15k budget, then you have other little better options.Pros:Except Camera, this phone is a 5 star phone. No issues at all.LCD Display is fantastic. Crisp and clear. 18.5:9 full screen display is awesome. If you don't like notch, you can hide it in settings.Battery backup is awesome. Survives more than a day when used it hard. And more than a day with normal use.I don't think not having type C is any issue.UI gives you multiple options. I loved it.Overall a good package. If they could have given best Camera in this package, it could have been a Diwali for consumers. But, I think they could have priced it higher then. 😊😃",1

5,Its just simply great for the price... I still cannot find any other phone in this range which can compete woth this phone. What is best is that although many phone can giv u greay spec for this price but till nobody is able to giv such a awesome build quality at this price. Metal n glass is truely premium. Display is adequately big n immersive. EMUI has improved so much and so fluid and it just keep getting better n better. Camera is good specially the night shot.

Rear camera quality is good, Selfie camera is average, it has issues with edge detection in  bokeh  mode. But most of the problems can be addressed with an update2. Sound output from the speaker is average, huawei could have given a louder speaker3. USB-C + Fast Charging could have been provided (I am nitpicking here)Overall the phone is great, if you are someone looking for a phone solely for the purpose of a camera, this wont be an ideal phone for you. For everyone else, this phone is great. just go for it.",0

Nd not disappointed.. Beyond limits...only issue is camera quality... Need to be improved as there are so many options in this price range, honour should have to notice. For a better camera one can go for redmi note 6 Pro... Other wise honour has no match in this category.",1

Provided with silicon cover.8. No heating issue.Cons:1. No type C port.2. No EIS support for video recording.3. Sound is comparatively low.4. At times it struggles in capturing photo in portrait mode from front camera.Overall a good device considering the price. Also got a six month display warranty as I got it during sale. Highly recommended if the budget is 15k.",0
5,"I liked the design, has less bazels,Hate the launcher and skin, user interface,  doest feels premium.And about the processor,, it is decent, but not so amazing, cannot Handel heavy loads,It doesn't supports Google latest GCAM apk port, it supports the old Gcam apk which doesn't have hdr+ enhanced mode, no night sight, only lens blue is available.  And i hated this.Front camera it's very good, for this price, it offers great quality selfies and the back camera is also good, but Video recording is very average, you won't get EIS or OIS,..And no usb type C port, it offers micro usb port,Display is quite good, but it is not comparable with AMOLED and OLED displays, they are just amazing, And the midst important part, it doesn't provides CORNING GORILLA GLASS PROTECTION,Over all, this phone is ok for the price,.  But I think Asus ZenFone Mac Pro m2 is a littelbit better choise, because of the big battery, stock launcher, user interface, CORNING GORILLA GLASS 6 protection, and It will support Google's latest GCAM with night shift and good portraits after enabling the CAMERA 2API,",1
5,"First sayingPUBG Runs awesome ! ⚔️As me had always been a huge fan of Honor Smartphones ,Being honest this Phone no Differ soIt will make You fall in love with it all the way !Firstly the Design ❤️The Display is no doubt the Best part of the phone 🖥️The KIRIN 710 performs Smooth and Efficient 🎰The Camera is just word taking 📸But the only thing made me disappointed is theAbsense of EIS 💔And the AI mode a huge drop over the Resolution ! It acts as 12MPinstade of 20 MPThe Sound Output is average but Cristal Clear ! 🔊The Battery lasts a single day easily with moderate usage 🔋Over all a perfect Package ! ❤️",1
4,"The phone is just gorgeous.The look and style feels so premium.The camera is really good in outdoor condition but kinda okay in indoor lightning. Same goes for the front camera.The display is no doubt good enough. It is bright, crisp and the viewing angles are good.The best part of this the battery. It lasts for around 2 days for me as I am a casual user. It charges really fast too.No connection issues. My airtel and jio is working flawlessly.Speaker sound output is decent. Not too loud and not too softThe only thing I didn't like about this is the notification led. It is very dull and placed in a horrible position.",1
4,"It's worth the money.Kirin 710 works like a charm.Sufficient RAM, good storage. Display is average. Camera is average. But value for money.Personally. I'm not big fan of EMUI. I bought this device for my brother. As a gadget freak, he loved this smartphone.Suggest anyone to buy this device, who is considering budget options. There are other honor devices on the same price range offering similar spect, but with slightly newer design, for example Honor 10 lite, nova 3i etc.",1
5,"First let me talk about the PROS1: Build quality- it is sheer delight holding this device, the glass back looks and feels so premium without knowing which phone this is nobody can even imagine that this costsjust 15k from Redmi note 6 pro ( not a typo it will launch this month) to MI A2 as well as Realme2 pro no phone can match the look and feel of this device2: Display- GORGEOUS nothing else to say3: Camera- Dont understand why a few people are bashing the camera on this, yes it lacks EIS but that can be fixed via an OTA, for photography this is no DSLR and no other phone even twice its price is. For the price this phone does its job. Nobody will tell you that the picture lacks in quality.CONS4: EMUI- UI is a matter of preference few people are complaining about occasional lagging of the phone and they are not wrong. Sometimes the UI lags although its minor but yes a bit disappointed on that.Audio:. This is the biggest con for me. The speakers are average but the output from Audio jack is POOR many a times I end up clicking the volume button in hopes that the volume would further increase.

5,I wish i could give more stars for speakers and batt. Life.... by reading reviews i was a bit skeptical about its audio quality... but ASA i had my hands on it.... sound is loud and clear...its past 1.5days i havnt charged my phone... battery is still 31%👍.Display is super.. camera is awesome... 9/10.. for it... i was a die hard samsung fan before... but now... i find this device...much powerful and flawless in this price range..Nothing i found..so that i may raise an issue abt it... its just a MARVEL...,1
5,Its been a more than a week i got this phone..Good till now big display..Battery backup is good than expected..Camera is also good with clarity both front and back..the only problem i am facing is with the head phone..sound is bit low when compared with other mobiles..without head phone volume is good with speakers...Not sure if my head phone is having issues..Over all good mobile..worth for money..i would suggest to get this if you are looking mobile in 15 to 20k range.,0
5,"This phone is totally awesome for this price.. Must buy.. Am reviewing after 3days usage... Am totally satisfied to its performance...Pros,1. Good pictures2. Good sound quality3. Good battery back up (normal usage up to 1 @ 1/2 days to 2 days) continuous usage 1 day4. Performance awesome5. No heating problem just some warm on long usageCons,👆 Please don't view something like cons when it comes to 16k with all new features. Bcoz it works superb then we expected.. 🙏I think my review may help you all..One of the honors best product honor 8X",1
4,"Camera quality is great , needs software update from Honor to get natural pictures , colour reproduction looks more saturated than what actually is, in sound department sound is clear through speaker whether you listen to music or anything, but its not too loud, 10/10 stars for build and design, front camera is same as rear one images look more saturated, though image quality is great, display is excellent , i would say best display in this price segment...",1
5,"Trust me this phone is well ahead of its time, in 15k you won't find 6.5 inch display with such clarity and screen to body ratio and beezels are next to non exsisting. Now its sound quality which is really good, i mean via headphone it lack amplification but don't get me wrong, at full volume it's loud enough with great bass and clarity, very much recommended for those who stays on headphone for long period. The best part is its call quality and signal reception , its simply outstanding. Battery is good enough but not for power users. Overall if you buy this product, it will not go out of style for atleast 3 years mainly considering its price.",1
4,"I ordered the blue colored Honor 8x in Amazon and got it on 1st week of November 2018. So I am using it for 6 months and here I want to share my experience.1) Battery Life : I am using my phone mainly for calling, Internet surfing, watching movies, live videos and lightweight gaming. I am not a PUBG fan, so can't say about it.. But as per my daily usage battery life is excellent and it is giving upto 1.5 days life with full charge.2) Display : Display is awesome especially for notch it gives a different look. The length-width ratio is nearly 2.5 and I like this type of shape where length width ratio is good.3) Camera : Rear cam is excellent for both normal and portrait mode photography. AI mode is also excellent. You will get some amazing default editing features. Front cam normal photography is good, but portrait mode is not accurate and can't focus multiple people at a time as it has single cam.4) Sound : Quality is good but could be much better as I was a Lenovo user previously and it gave Dolby Atmos. Also it has single speaker so sound is not so loud.5) Processor : Phone performance is good, never faced any hanging issue till now.Hence as per my experience this is a nice phone and you should buy it if your budget is within 15000/-",0
5,"My Papa is too very much happy with this edge to edge phone. He was using a a 2 GB RAM phone earlier. And you can imagine, how drastic this will become now. Works fact, bright screen superb UI and its camera its super. In this price range I say this is the beast phone hardware with features are of some luxury phone.Camera is good. You can really take very good photographs if you know tools of pro mode.",0
5,Such amazing phone. Can't find any cons in this device. I've been intensively using it and honor 8x has left no loopholes in its performance. And notch design and look wise it is unbeatable and such an amazing phone in such affordable price. Go team Honor. Lots of love from your happy buyer. 💙,0
4,Phone looks and feels pretty much premiumBattery backup is worth it but not when you play games drains 12% to 14% in half an hour but YouTube and browsing drains just 7-8% per hour and it charges like 60% to 80 in 15 mins able to run 2-3 heavy applications in background (Camera sucks) this phone is not for camera lovers but value for money can't deny kirin 710's performance and several super useful features are just awesome.. BTW I have dropped the phone right away out of the box but nothing happened phone is bit slippery and heavy but its beautiful though,0

5,"This is a brilliant phone, everything is just good about it. For 15k, one can have all flagship features for which we have to shell out in excess of 25-35k. The Camera, Display & Sound are great and on top of that the battery takes all the honors. I have a Samsung S9 as well but trust me, Honor 8x is pretty much competing with it. I am a Techie myself, so before buying, I thoroughly went through all the aspects and after having used it for almost 7 days now, I am in completely awe with this phone's performance.

Speaker & earphone volume could be better4. No earphone with the pack,0
4,Excellent product in price range... Given good tricks in camera... Forgot any review... Easy to handle... Easy to use... Best UI. Full entertaining phone. There is no issue in mobile only small thing we can say.. Night shots aren't perfect but we can not blame to company... With the small amount we can not expect hefty features. The camera is awasome. Overall it's a worthy phone. The mobile is not bulky and easy to use. Recommending some one who is buying xioami phone. Phone looks premium In hand and people will definitely ask to you.,1
5,"The phone packs everything it should for the price range and comes in a package that is more than desirable. Decent camera, great screen, good enough battery with a frugal power consumption. Average usage can easily take you through the day. Paired with the right kind of earphones, this makes for a great device for media consumption. And the looks, it gives most flagships a run for their money with its gorgeous gradient back panel covered in glass. Build quality also feels great and doesn't feel like looks come at the cost of sturdiness. Glass panels do make it a bit vulnerable, but there are crackling of panels as such. Very solid fit and finish.",0
4,"Have used all Honor phones starting from Honor 4x,5c,9N & now this. This is a great upgrade from 4x. This is a vivo v9 pro killer at a best price. Superb display, great battery,wow speed,great UI. The speakers output is loud & good, however the the bass & treble effects are completely missing. It's more of voice than the other sounds. So for music enthusiasts it will be lil disappointing. But I wonder how Honor approved this speakers.  Camera is great & Color rich. Both front & rear takes fabulous pics. Then on UI front, take it from me, no UI can come near any Honor phones, incl Redmi,vivo,OPPO or even iPhone. This is a great value for money you can bet on. Quality on top notch. BLINDLY GO FOR IT...",1
5,"What a complete package it is! Gives battery backup of more than 1 day, sound quality is nice too, speakers are loud enough, I don't know why honor 8x users are complaining about the same. Camera quality is average, it would be better not to use AI feature btw. Screen looks vibrant and attractive. Phone can be handled easily, Design is really really attractive. Back is glossy, It would be too risky to carry the device without cover case though. Fingerprint sensor is excellent.Now moving to the cons, It takes a very long time to be charged, face unlock is terrible, takes 1-2 seconds to unlock, and sometimes it doesn't even work!! front camera is below averageTo sum it all, the phone is definitely worth buying 😊",0
4,"I have been using a Samsung Galaxy S7 so far for last two years. It is good. When I saw on Amazon the details of Honor 8X I decided to try at least once a Chinese phone so I chose this purely for pricing reasons.After using this for almost 20 days my review is as follows:1. Over all the phone is a good product,  4 star rating.2. Camera is good but needed image stabilization which is not provided.3. Display is really good at this price.4. Picture quality is Ok. Neither bad nor great. Though there are many controls in camera UI.5. Screen size with 6.5 inches it's easy to hold by one hand. This is really good.6. Battery life is superb. I am very heavy user with lots of mails and what's app etc. But still the battery lasts for minimum one and a half day.This phone has a big shortcoming, that I observed in my case..others may never face that. I have lot of.phone related softwares and they are paid license versions but Honor refuses to pair with other phones, directly through blue tooth or through PC. So you can't transfer your contacts, what's app and other stuff from one phone to other. This is a bit trouble. I tried even with their own app but that failed. So in such a case your investment is eco system is not useful.Overall this is a good phone and I am enjoying using this.",0
5,Excellent big screen phone with generous RAM and ROM memory. Fingerprint scanner and face recognition work really well. Good cameras and processor seems to cope well without any lag. Great for watching videos or playing games (6.5 inch screen). Decent battery lasts well over a day or longer.,0
4,"Review after 7 days!Got my phone ( 6 + 64) on amazon sale at 12800 with discount and exchange offer.Initial impressions:Display very good.Battery good. Not more not less.Moderate use and it will last 1.5 days very easily.Must use a tempered glass.Camera very good. AI feature is very effective.Build quality : Looks good. I didn't do any test for it but on hand it feels solid.After update it supports direct video calling.Performance : Good . I tried moderate games ( no PUBG, asphault 8) .Will update after some day .Apart from gaming other multi apps usage and cpu intensive works doesn't feel lagging.Cons :1. Notification light is very small(most users don't care)2. Glass back beware.3. I didn't find anything else now.Will update my review after 30 days use.Review after 30 days of purchase:Got pie update. After update the camera quality becomes slight better. Battery  backup very good. No lag found.",0
5,"Its an overall great phone in its segment with following pro n cons:Pros:1. Battery last 2 days with moderare use and more than one day with heavy use2. Large 6.5 inch display packed in relatively compact body, which is possible due to great 91% screen to body ratio3. No software lags in, n phone operation is fast4. Fast finger print n face detection5. Built quality is good n it also look great n premiumCons:1. No gorilla glass2. No USB C type charger2. Avg. Camera n sound",0
4,"Very good phone for the price. Camera is ok not very good not very bad. Batgery life is also in between. Look wise very good phone u r gonna love it. Phone heats on little use, heating is not too much, it never heats too much but even little heat is problematic while calling. Performabce is very good. No lags hangs etc. Smooth performance. Software is neat and clean. Very little customization. Speakers are not very loud. One thing- US ban - no issue with my phone but people buying new huawei devices should be cautious of us ban",0
5,"I've purchased this phone for my mom. The phone is excellent. It's physical appearance is very appealing and makes it look like a premium phone. The performance in terms of speed is very good and also because of honor's GPU turbo, gaming is a breeze. The battery life is good but it misses out on quickcharge. The speaker is average but headphone music quality is good. Calls are also good. Overall I would recommend this mobile",0
5,"Looks are stunning. It doesn't feel like i bought it for 13.5K 4gb variant, it has looks of a premium category phone. Display looks huge although breadth is same as all other have. Display is very vibrant as LTPS lcd is used.U don't have to see ads everywhere like in Xiaomi phonesAI camera is fast in detecting scenes+Got phone cover and screen guard already applied over screen. Which will cost another 250 if u search to buy.",0
5,Awesome phn wid awesome looks & features.. Have been using for 4 months now.. Good battery life.. Camera is pretty gd.. Fingerprint reader is also working well..Apart from these I m little worried about the looks.. The paint on  the bezels are fading.. dnknw whthr bcoz I m using a hard case..And the other thing which I noticed is the screenguards which available on the market are not compatible for the screen.. So I choose not to apply screenguards by taking a risk of breaking the screen bcz I pay attention on looks..Except these two little things... Phn is 🤩🤩🤩👍,0
5,"Much has been said about this great device. This is a perfect phone for those looking for device in price range within 15k. Exceptionally fast, great battery, beautiful screen, and last but not the least, it comes with Android Oreo out of the box. Though, the camera is bit hyped. Honestly speaking, I am not satisfied with camera quality, but hey that doesn't mean it is bad or something, just doesn't quite works in low lighting and lack EIS /OIS and 4k, which I feel are the only shortcomings of this Beautiful phone. Not to mention this phone is refreshingly gorgeous, premium glass back, and perhaps the smallest bezels. Loved this device, and extremely SATISFIED!",0
5,"Looks and design are just marvellous. Light & brightness are also good. Expected headfone but didn't get. overall fone is total upto the mark as shown in pic.

4,"The battery life phone is awesome. The camera on the other hand beautiful however there are some picture quality issues. But works fine. The selfies are good. Fingerprint and face unlock features are very fine. The video quality is very fine to watch not to shoot. The speed is incredible and the display is very fine. However the sound quality is above average and the loudness seems be above average too. Hopefully, the software update can fix camera.

4,"Pros:*Theres plenty of customisation options for the screen colours and reader mode is available built in.*Light weight OS. Not really any bloatware you should be concerned about UNLESS you've activated the services which you have option to not do so during setup. No ADS or anything unless you accepted certain inbuilt services during setup.*Face recognition and fingerprint scanner are super smooth and super fast.*Gaming performance is very good and no stutters on heavy games.*Very good screen size and resolution. Some colours do feel a bit off(like the blue frame on facebook while browsing on chrome) but its not much noticeable, just looks like HDR a bit.Watching movies you really cant tell and it plays heavy files smoothly and clearly on players like VLC.*No battery warming. Its just mild even with cover on when charging but stays low and doesnt get heated. While gaming too it gets slightly warm sometimes(not hot) but most of the time it wont.Cons:*Almost laughed when I saw the quality of photos. Very bright and saturated reds, areas that have shadows are lit up like christmas trees which makes them more bright than the areas that are lit in some cases. Texture looks like its been painted. So camera is horrible. Maybe theres settings you can change but I cant seem to get it better.",0
4,"Amazing phone.... Its fast, durable for daily use and owns a great AI powered battery enough to take you through the day. The kirin 710 performs very well in terms of gaming. The camera quality is also great. The glass back gives an amazing feel of a flagship phone in hand.The sound quality could have been improved a little.Honor 8x also lacks flash charging. But thats just a software update issue. Hope to see a flash charge software update for this amazing phone in the future.",0
5,"Honor 8x is a great phone with a big beautiful display and great battery life. The photos come out great in good lighting conditions. Only gripe I have is about the product delivery time, it took 10 days. Coming from Mi max 2, I have no complaints as such, apart from a somewhat reduced battery endurance. But that is to be expected.Also, the AI mode has a tendency to oversaturate colours, but it can be easily turned of anytime you like.In conclusion, best build quality in the Rs 15000 range and a surprisingly compact phone for such a huge display.",1

5,Best phone to buys under ₹15000. Best all rounder and  true value for money.Day light camera performance is prity awesome but If you can manage with below par low light camera performance then buy it without any doubt. Audio from the speaker phone is average and battery performance is prity good as it runs for whole day with heavy usage. Absolutely no issues with any kind of connectivity. Display is fantastic. Look and feel is super premium.,1

5,"Writing this review after three weeks of usage.Iam not going to mention any specs because you guys know it already. I will point out the things that experienced great for me.1. Excellent design. 👌The dual tone will look extremely premium on your hand. I think there are no such device currently look this much good under this price category. Period!2. Night shot on camera -As usual honor cameras are doing pretty well. The night mode at this device will provide clear shots during night time.3.Lag free bloatware less EMUI- Unlike the redmi and vivo phones, the EMUI will provide you smooth and lag free performance. The kirin 710 and 4gb of ram will do the job efficiently.4. Charging and battery- Even if there is no fast charging available, this device will charge upto 90% within 1.30 hr. The battery will last for 1.5 days with normal usage.5. For PUBG lovers-  you can play any high graphics game like pubg with no issues.6. Efficient notch -Iam not a big fan of notch, But this device comes with smaller notch, and it includes notification LED! It may be silly thing.But LED not available in many devices with notch.Thanks for reading guys. Trust me guys, this is a beast under 20k category👌",0
4,Only issue is the ear speaker of the mobile vibrates during calls (feels like its due to loudness). And need to purchase a new back case as the back case provided by honor is too slippery. Camera quality is not upto the mark. Apart ftom these issue mobile is awesum..Issues: But the (1) packaing is not as safe as it was in my earlier orders. (2) Fake offer details provided in offers section. It was said that i will be getting airtel data offer for prepaid customers of 20 gb on recharge of 199 (total of 1tb data) with this mobile. But i didnt received the same. I have contacted the service center of both amazon and airtel. Both failed to resolve my request regarding this. Amazon customer service was worst this time as she failed to even understand my query and provided few fake details which were not been mentioned in offer section.,0

Only drawback is, out of 4GB ram, less than 2GB is available to user. I do not do any gaming and have limited apps installed still have noticed this. Ram management could be better, also when switching better screens it jitters a little at times.",0
4,"This is my third honor phone after 6X and 9 lite. While it's a major upgrade in built quality, screen display & size, battery life, there are scope of improvement in Camera and sound quality. 9 lite's dual front cameras were better. While the price tag doesn't allows too many high end specs, having a notch with 6.5 inches display, dual sim + memory card support, AI enabled camera with panorama effect are really good to have features. I also wish phones with 3500+ mAh batteries supports fast charging. Overall, value for money to have 8X, won't hesitate to recommend it to my friends.",1
5,"It's really a good purchase. Product was supplies in two days by Amazon. After 3 months of usage, the mobile is working fine without any flaws. Maintain battery for 1.5 to 2 days of moderate usage without heavy gaming. I am fully satisfied. One of the drawback to mention is camera captures good images but paints with slight artificial over colour. Anyhow the performance is very good. Nice smartphone at below 15000 budget.",0

There are special modes like ride mode, party mode etc which are really interesting.

If I use earphone I can't even here properly at full volume.. For this reason I have already exchanged once but got the same result which is very disappointing.. Other than speakers I just loved d phone..Camera, build quality, look, everything.. Idon't want 4k recording n other things.. But a good speaker is a must.. .. Please do correct it by upgradation.. I don't want to return it just for speakers.. It's a request.. Please..",0

5,"Over the last few years, I had used some of the Smartphones like OnePlus One, Nexus 6, iPhone 7 but these phones are nowhere comparable to the Honor 8X. When I thought of buying a phone, I had waited for OnePlus 6T, somehow because of the price tag I choose not to buy that. Then my alternate option was Xiaomi or Honor or Oppo.After several reviews and analysis I thought, let me go with Honor 8X. Now I feel My choice is good.I have been using this phone from last 3 weeks and until now my experience is quite good with this device1. Ultimate Performance ( downloaded and using 100+ apps),2. Good battery life (2 days on a normal usage)3. Camera Quality is fantastic than my earlier smart phones and is on par with the latest phones.4. Handy even though the size is 6.2 Inches.5. Face unlock performance is good.6. Interesting Android features, Camera Features, Picture Editing features7. Full Screen Display8. Display Quality is quite good",1
4,"First thing first....Amazing 6.5"" Display,Premium look, thanks for dual tone back.RAM management is too good, 2.3-2.5 GB always free.Battery life: 1+ day for normal use.Sound Quality: sound quality is crispy but not very loud.I'm not like custom UIs, but EMUI is prety good and not having any trouble to move from pure android.Only one thing I missed personally I.e Google Now Launcher.Overall it's worthy purchase.",0
5,this is great phone in this range. I have ordered this phone and i was so amazed due to battery life and other feature. I have ordered same phone for my wife and my mother. Camera quality is not very great but after update it work well.,0
4,"after 7days of use I can say that this phone is an absolute beast in this price range. It looks so premium and the large FHD display is very nice, though No gorilla glass protection in it.. selfies are awesome in this phone, rear camera is good, though in my opinion, redmi note5pro/A1 takes better quality images in this range.. Battery is of 3750mah, but the kirin software is battery-friendly so easily it can last upto 1nd a half day with moderate usage in spite of keeping Internet always on. it has triple slot so I installed my sd card too which is a big plus-point for me.. Sound quality of d in-built speaker is good though not d best.. U can easily play all the high end games like pubg in this phone.. till now no heating issues too..  so I can highly recommend it to others in 15K range",1
5,"Its really awesome trending phone under this price segment so if yu ar thinking about it buy it, there is no issue i had compared with real me 2 pro but honor 8x was always winner..... ☺️ so yu can buy awesome with amazing camera.  Don't go for realme 2 pro its plastic body nd camera 🎥  is not good. THANKYOU",1
5,I have been a iphone user since the iphone 3gs days i still have a iphone 7 even than I didnt had any issue with this phone at all. HONOR 8x aganist its competotiors is a bit under rated that is what feel. If you are thinking to buy go BUY without any second thoughts. HONOR phones are not well advertised thats why people know less about these phones. This phone has a fantastic design great performance great screen quality and a good battery life.I LOVE THIS PHONE,1
5,"Whatever i write here will be not enough for this phone, and anyhow you guys will see other reviews and videos from other sources.Still i will say i am impressed with its performance in all the aspects, battery, camera, video, sound and gaming. All are perfectly fine and performing absolutely fine.",0
5,Honor has stepped up the game for all budget phone makers. The display and the designs are magnificent on the honor 8x. The premium feel in hand and just the right size makes you feel in love with the phone. The battery lasts for 1 day tops to be frank and the camera couldve been better as well.. However night modes and well lit objects can be captured with decent quality on the honor 8x. The voice and call quality are superb with low SAR value. If you are on a budget of 15k this would definitely be my choice..otherwise go for one plus 6t if you want the pros of honor 8x with good camera as well..,1
5,"The camera is too good when the AI is turned on but only in the natural light i.e outdoor. The pictures taken under artificial lighting are very poor, the updates are coming in this honor device. The glass back is pretty awesome with an expensive feeling but the problem is the fingerprint that remains on the glass as we take the phone in hand. Fingerprint sensor is fast and battery life is 24 hr for me as I play PUBG for more than 3 hrx with a great experience shared by the processor.",0
4,"Phone is really good, But it missed the options like Advance security options like secure startup and it is not good.Pros:Big screen,Battery,Dual Camera,Split screen,Dual stand by 4G-VOLTE,Super face unlock,finger print placement is really good,sleek and superb design.Cons:Lack of EIS,Front flash,Fast charging,You cant view videos in full view(It occupies only 5.5 inches while playing video we have to duple tap for zoom)You can go for it.",0
4,Its my first time reviewing a phone.1.battery;its good enough but not ty o the mark but if ur not a gamer then its enough for u.2.picture:not good at night3:sound :loud enough but not to the markOver all ita a good phone am satisfied enough tks amazon. And tks honor,0
5,"Camera:One word is enough i.e AWSEOME. Various modes and portrait mode is decent, AR lens, pro mode, AI recognition everything is good. One thing that blew my mind is night mode, my room is full of dark and snap a pic with night mode, and the output is awesome. It takes the light in dark and gave an amazing picture.Battery:Excellent. I play PUBG and it lasts for one day even I use a long time. But for a normal user, it lasts for 2 days.Display and Design:Notch is decent and looking pretty good. You will love the design if u see real phone.My variant is blue and I am feeling sooo nice with that, the texture and the glass back is good, you have to use back cover, because it's so slippery. Display is good.Performance:6gb ram and 64gb ROM, I have not seen any hang and lag in performance. Processor is so fast and apps opening, managing is pretty good. Using 6 to 8 apps, including gaming I have not seen any issues in performance.Gaming:I play PUBG frequently, and I am seeing any lab while gaming. The lag occurs only if there is network problem.Heating:I have not seen any heating issues. A little bit heat while playing PUBG, but not too much, recovers within short time.After the purchase of 2 months it asked for update of Android Pie, after the update, the performance levels increased, thanks to Honor.Overall:Camera - 4.5/5Display and Design - 5/5Performance - 5/5Gaming - 4/5",0
5,"1. Awsome phone2. Sound quality is not too loud.3. Picture quality in day light is very good but very bad in night.4. Battery life is good, takes 2hr10min to charge from 0 to 100% and last upto 2 complete days if you use below average, last upto 1.5 day on moderate use, and last easily upto 1 day on high uses.5. Back side look is more the suprb.",0
5,First Honor 4x then 6x and now using 8x... All the phones have one similarity .. they never had heating issue what's so ever...I just love Honor build quality.. picture quality and user interface...and five star for Amazon,0
5,Best phone till date within this price range. Amazing camera and display quality. You cam simply play with the camera. AI mode will help you to identify the picture mode and will give you a decent photo. Photo processor adds a bit more color which is not that bad. Battery backup is good but we expected a bit better.  But you can easily depend on it. Once the device is fully charged it can stay upto 1day with all day activity. Sound quality is balanced both on handphone and device speaker. Finest combination of bass and treeble. Built quality is too good but its always good to use the in box case to protect the back as it is made of glass.Lastly gaming performance is good. I have played PUBG and clash of clan in this device. Had no issues while playing both the games. But while playing PUBG for a longer period of time slight heat observed which is very normal.,1
5,I am not a tech freak neither a gadget geek but still phones are something which I always admire. This phone attracted me due to its color afterall its my favorite color but when I used this I was not able to resist myself from writing the review.Phone looks is awesome anyone can fall in love with it.Bezel less design give it a feel high end segment phone.Screen resolution is phenomenal as watching HD videos are real fun.Dual camera really shoot images as proSound quality is greatPhone spedd is greatDont know about gaming experience. At decent price best phone.,1
5,"Ultimate smartphone at this price.. picture quality, sound, battery durability.. everything is awesome.. i've bought 6gb ram version.. and all the heavy games are running very smoothly... Great mob for game lovers... I use to charge it once in one and half day.  Great battery backup.. but be careful about screen because it doesn't have gorilla glass.. i'll suggest to use good quality screen guard and cover..",0
5,"It is the one of the best choice from its segment as its a honor you won't be dissapointed with its finger print, screen quality and camera, built quality,  only probs  only some will find if you don't use to do video recording as it doesn't have an eis or ois other than that nothing to worry about processor,battery,  built quality simply go for it the kirin 710 will do anything for you it has also made a score on one of the best smartphone of 2018",1
5,"Pros:- Looks great and lovely FHD+ display- Feels good in the hand because of its narrower and taller design- Really small notch (which can be hidden if you are not interested in seeing a notch)- Very thin ""chin"" to give an almost bezel-less experience- Very good battery life- Good crisp photosCons:- No EIS.. Videos will be shaky unless you are super stillNo fast-charging.. Comes with only 5V~2A charger",0
5,After one month of its usage..I come across here with 5 takeaways of this phone.1.No doubt currently it's the stylish ever phone in market.2.Best in 15K budget till date (for all specs)3.Best rear camera 20MP+2MP even in 20-25k range.4.Battery Life is Pretty Good for 3750Mah. It could be be better. But still it's ok.5.Ram Management is pretty OK. It just lags once or twice while playing large games.(Overall judgement)VALUE FOR MONEY.,1
4,"I am very happy with this product... Present now I am writing review with this honor 8x...Battery life is average... But it completes whole day with single charge... Camera is Very good... Finally honor 8x is alround smartphone with good camera, good battery life with bigger 6.5 inch screen...",0
5,"Honor 8X is the best smartphone you can get at this segment, the phone looks great like a flagship device, such a gorgeous looking device, camera quality is awesome, Night mode is good if you take pictures at night, battery life is absolutely great, you'll get 7 hours of screen on time in moderate usage. Overall a great device for the price. Totally satisfied with Honor 8x.",1
4,All featurs of Good looking honor 8x is Awesome. 6gb RAM work well for device Applications. In some area picture quality need to improve. Sound quality gud with internal setting effects 👍. Battery will end up by a day for heavy user but fast charging missing. Overall a gud combination for perfect device.If #HonorIndia able to give Regularly system updates (OTA) then it will surely became a great device for 2~3 years in this Price segment.,0
5,"Battery - Battery life is too good, it lasts one full day with heavy usage like playing pubg and watching videos.Camera - Though my first impression was bad but after I disabled the AI and changed few settings, the camera is pretty good. The highlight is super slow motion and night mode.Display - This is where it stands out in the crowd, its perfect.Performance - I am using the 4gb ram variant and there is no lag, it handles everything you throw at it.Don't think twice, just go fit it 👍",0
5,"I absolutely loved this product.Its features are amazing.Picture quality is so good. Such clear and amazing pictures.Even the screen looks like a 4K screen. So clear and vivid colours. You'll love everything and the additional features to add to the screen for vivid colours.It also has a feature to stop blue light from a certain time. Eg. From 10PM-6PM. Which will let you sleep on time and comfort your eyes in the dark.Sound quality is good too.Storage is very good. You can add a memory card too. Which is a plus point. Since you can't add an additional memory card to a phone which already has a dual sim slot.Also, the appearance looks very elegant.I absolutely love the back cover. The blue shiny thing looks super classy",0
5,I'm posting this based on my last seven days of usageExcellent build quality with reasonable priceFelt best in the segmentPerformance is good and there is no lagYou can load up to 6 to 10 apps at a time and you will not observe any lagging.Battery performance and optimisation is really goodThere is no draining of batteryBattery will be more than enough for a full day usageCamera gives you a decent clarity and some best pictures at a very good lighting conditions.Very handy to use use and it is not bulkierThanks to the designCalling  and network reception quality is exceptionalDual volte works great and smoothHisten audio effects for headphones are impressive please activate it while using your headphonesSumming up it is a great phone and worth the buyDefinitely go for it you will be surprised with it's quality,1
5,"I am using this phone for last 1 month. So, here is my review :-1. The display of this phone is awesome.2. Great battery life.3. Camera pictures are great in daylight.4. AI camera modesNot so good things are :-1. Night mode pictures are blurred out.2. The selfie camera clicks picture which are very bright, looks artificial.3.LED notification light is very small.Still I can say this is good phone to go for. Buy it. You will not regret with Honor.",0
5,"Display-5/5The bottom chin is soo soo small and screen to body ratio makes it more premium in hands ..you gonna love watching movies and playing games.Camera- In day light -4/5  In low light- 3/5Fine in day light takes some really nive pictures but in low light even in under shadow it strugles a lot to take good pictures but yes night mode is good .No 4k No EIS for videos.Processor- 4.5/5Handles everything smoothly..u can play pubg in HD settings without lags.Built- 5/5Best built under 20k.. believe me ..eye catchy.. mine is black one.Performance- 4.5/5Handles everything you throught to it smoothly.Day to day experience is very nice.Battery life- 5/5Gives 6-7 (even more sometimes) of screen on time ..battery optimization is really niceTakes almost 2 hours to get fully charged (0-100).And yesSound quality- 3.5/5Speaker is not soo loud u need to maximize volumn to 100% to listen something even inside  home, and in earphones u need to listen at 75-80% level if u listen 50% in other devices .Overall a nice option to buy in 15k budget aparg from average low light camera and little less loud speaker.Loved it 😍",1
4,This is my first honour phone and I am really impressed.. it has a 6.5 inch stunning display ..awesome design and build quality i ..it feels like a premium phone ..the phone size is same as mi A2 or note 5 pro but here you get bezel less display ...battery backup is awesome ...the emui OS is not bad either ...the only con is the average camera and video quality ..but if you take photos and videos occassionally then go for it guys ..don't doubt,0
5,Amazing Features Loaded Phone. Everything is perfect. Working Like a most premium phone of markt. Very Stylish & Impressive Phone. I am Old Huawei Fan So would definitely suggest everyone to get your hands on it. also got at fantastic deal from amazon & less than 24 hrs upon ordered i received the phone.,0
5,"Superp Design...Good performance...Good Gaming Experience...Smooth Touch...Not that bulky nor too heavy too.. Its easly Managble size with large screen display, sleek design nd light weight...Very fast unlock finger sensor... Faceunlock also good...Whole day lasting battery for sure... (And don't worry about missing fast charge.. Charging speed is great for a micro usb port.. "" saying becoz u can not down grade this fon just due to that missing facility""Good set of cameras...(i don't know why people complaint a lot about its cameras, trust me guys it really does it's job pretty neat. May be those who are too professional about the frequent photographs might not like it, but come on its a phone not a dslr) Any how selfies are not bad at all in this u will like it, not very great either, but decent.PS: Lack of EIS might be a problem for video recording though i guess, don't know much about it coz i am not too much a video person..! ""hope fully any future near updates would solve it.""1 Gud thing to tell : Amazon delivery was very very fast, got within just two days of order placement dat too all the way from Maharastra to Kerala, without any special payment for fast delivsry. Was well packed got safe nd sound & secured..!1  bad thing to tell: fon charger was lil damaged or dislocated for the usb receiver to get inside the port, but after some cautious struggle got it placed in correct position.Over all very satisfied,*Its an all rounder package*if you liked the specs and looks of the fon with the price ok for you... Then You can surely go for it without any hesitation, I am sure it wont let you down..Tips for colour selection confused guys.. Black is neat clean & low profile, but on other hand it wont show the full glimse of its design or beauty..nd dat too above a plain clear back case put at back.. Nothing is really visible..Blue is the actual colour for this fons show with its back glass two tone differntiation and vibrant colour and design.. But for those who like blue..Red also same as blue, will definitely stand out of the crowd... But again those who like red...I bought 6gb ram 64 gb rom Black colour fon coz i lyk to keep it low profile & i love nd prefer black becoz it goes with any dress we wear, at any time and any where It is..Thanks nd sorry for being lil lengthy...Njoy.. 😉😊👍🏻",0
4,Super phone with smart looks and very good battery back up. Phone gets charged very quickly. Very smooth operation. Only problem is camera cause photos look too much edited and too much beautification but AI camera dose very good while taking nature's photo. Take little while getting use to phone as screen is big.,0
5,"Brilliant execution by the Huawei Engineering team. You guys truly know how to make great phones.I found NO problems with heat, battery life and camera and sound output.For those who experience battery problems, you need to install apps directly from the play store and not from a backup. This keeps everything clean.Excellent camera in both daylight and low light. Use the night mode in low light or enable the moving objects feature!! Selfie camera captures lots of light. Both the front and back cameras are very fast. AI mode does seem to increase staturation. In some environments, AI does improve the picture quality. Very easy to disable in scenes where its not required. AI is not enabled by default.Sound output on speaker is as good as any other phone. I found it as loud as my Samsung Note. As with any phone speaker, use a bluetooth speaker in noisy environments. To get an optimal headset experience, use the sound settings to choose the type of headphones connected.Now for the real pros.1) Eye comfort. This is excellent!! For people who use phones to read and to get work done, this feature is a must have!! Eye comfort gets rid of the blue light completely. My eyes didnt tire out as it does with other phones and laptops, specially after 11 at night.2) Excellent display. Super clarity. One look and you can feel the colors pop.3) Automatic brightness works amazingly well. Its very fast to detect changing light environments.4) Build quality and screen size - Huawei has put a lot of thought into this and it shows. Feels smooth, solid and premium!!5) Firefox, Chrome, Skype, Word, Excel, Camera etc etc instantly load from RAM. Excellent memory management.Looking forward to some great updates.",1
4,After one month of usage of this productIam reviewing this product.Firstly at this price point mostly give polycarbonate but this phone comes with metal finishing and glass at the back which is appreciated and the look and feel of this phone is amazing you will does not have any problems with built quality of this phone at this price.Now in terms of performance it has a 12 nm based kirin 710 processor due to which performance is amazing it plays pubg butter smooth as I played pubg for 2 hours in highest possible settings and does not feel any heating issue in this device and in day to day usage it is amazing in terms of performance.In terms of camera its not great but decent as shown in samples given its night mode take very nice pictures and i could say that camera is decent at this price point both front and rear but it does not have eis which should be there.Now the display I dont know why people are criticising its display you get LTPS 6.5 INCHES display with notch which has vibrant colours and amazing viewing angles display is really nice trust me.As far battery is concerned its also amazing as it can easily last upto one and a half days for moderate users and for even heavy users it can last upto one day easily so interms of battery life it performs well.CONCLUSIONIF ur budget is 15 k just go for this phone its really nice and a stable phone in terms of every aspect of it. This phone is a nice choice to go for than that of realme or asusIt feels far more premium than these brands.Just go with it you will not regret.THANKYOU if you get some help from this review then it is really appreciated.,0
5,"From many months , i desperately want to buy this phone after seeing it's features and reviews on youtube.Especially it's looks are at beyond awesomeness. Super glossy on back and Massive 6.5 inch display which looks beautiful.I have some minimum requirements for everyphone is that Good battery backup , Good camera , Looks and performance. I thought this is a perfect phone for me which possess everything that i need. Basically, it is best balanced featured phone in my opnion.I've seen many reviews on youtube before buying it and gained many positive reviews.After when i unbox my phone. It's so massive on my hands and it's looking beautiful and glossy black on back. I was struggled to operate in beginning and after 2, 3 days . I just loved this phone. In every department, this phone doing well.I just shocked to see the battery back.It has extra ordinary battery backup which i gotten what i need.It lasts for 1 and half days for medium users. And for frequent users, it lasts one day in my prediction.The camera is doing well and actually it is so good. I saw in some reviews that it's camera isn't good. But it's very good. The display which i loved the most.It is so eye-catching to see videos on this one. And in terms of Performance. I didn't notice any bugs and issues till now.Just minor issues that are solved easily with settings which was instructed by honor helpcare from fb. Eventually, Everything is awesome in this phone.You'll never regret buying this. Highly recommended by me.",1
4,"Pros: I really love the phone because of its display size and the build quality. I have the blue variant which looks very premium.  Battery would easily last for 2 days on average use. Performance on par with SD636 and 660. Nice set of cameras, but still needs to improve.Cons: Poor volume levels in music playback(very low volume). Stutters during game play especially PUBG.",0
5,Its was great experience from last 2 months use but only the issue with online website zoomed and cant reduce size that why many pages words & content cut off like Online bank statement cant see 100%. I hope its will be correct in next update. Other wise batter is best & last lasting than my previous mi phones. Picture clearity is best in class.,1
5,"Wanted a phone with a notch, because I loved iPhone x but couldn't afford it..This phone delivers much more than what you could expect in this price range.. You can go for it without second thoughts..Battery is good, but not great. No fast charging is a draw back..But on the whole will be a worthy choice",0
5,"This is an comprehensive review of honor 8x.Look- this is where it shows off, the mobile comes with a stunning dual colour tone which is absolutly amazing.The colour tone, thus differs in black and the other two(red and blue)In black you get a dark - light with no patterns and in the other colours you get some cool paterns.Performance-i used a 4 gb varient which is really stunning, popular games like player unknowns battle ground ect works fine.Multiple applications are also fair.Camara-the rear and front camara are amazing but since the front cam does not come with flash, its not that awsm.Other than that its perfect, slow mo,,,, time lapse ect. Totall perfect!Notch-this smartphone has the one of the best smartphone notches.The notch itself is not that big probabily likeA inch which means you get more screen space.Ps it has a fully functional notch, the earpice is the best among all it comes in this circular shape, it also has an colour sensor and activity status light.But no type c or fast charging 🖕Overall a go for 15k budget.Thank you!",1
5,It's 4 days now I am using this beast. I ordered it on 3nov and got the delivery by 6th. Well I am a little bit disappointed by it's camera quality on low light conditions. It's camera definitely takes a hit when it comes to photography on low light. With adequate lighting you can expect good results but not better. It's night mode can give u better results. The camera just delivers excellent results in good lighting conditions say from morning till 5oclock max. The overall performance is good. No lag. Buttery smooth. Battery gives me 1and half day juice. I am not a sort of heavy gamer. Sound quality is good. And yaa there is no support for fast charging. But it takes only 2hours max to charge from 10-100percent. Overall it's a nice device. Hope honor can issue the photography in lowlights by pushing an update soon. And also eis is missing on this phone.,0
5,"In short I'll say, it's the best looking android of any budget for me as on date after mate 20 Pro.The camera is very good for me as I don't have much knowledge of mobile photography so it's more than what I require. The display is mammath in this small package & was the sole reason of my buy after the mammath battery size.I just love my this phone. Thanks Honor & Amazon",1
5,"Got it on 29th April and now only after 4 days it is 2000 rupees less,very irritating. I bought a 4gb 64 gb mobile on 14999 and now they are selling 6gb 64gb in same price. That's a massive difference.",0
4,"Hi Guys, you will come across tons of reviews of positive feedback of this device . they are true, up to an extent.I will drive you through the major drawback of this device after using it around 2 months now.PROS:You can find easily in every other review :).CONS1. Camera: it's pathetic in low light, portrait mode too look like over saturated.2. Charging cable low quality. Mine gets damaged, don't know how?2. Lack of service centers: This is biggest failure. In Noida itself, they have only 1 service center. That too, is third party center(Managing four different brands with low quality staff) where hardly you would find appropriate treatment for your issue.If honor team can work on these flaws, it can be the best device in segment.",1
4,"Honour 8x purchased with offer price on diwali,It, s having stunning look, big screen,every thing I liked but only thing is it doesn't have direct vedeo calling option, that's made disappointing, we can make vedeo calsl by using third party apps.",0
4,"The best phone from Honor till date, mind blowing built, decent camera, battery life is a huge plus, the display and features of this phone is brilliant and the proceasor does a great job, sadly i received a phone with a big scratch on the tempered glass so have placed a request for return but due to. Demand the blue color is gone out of stock and sadly the customer services and escalation team are totally pathetic, i spoke to 5 different people starting from Akila, priya, preeti, escalation team expert Venkatesh k and Sunil and all blame each other that the previous person didnt guide you with the correct process, hopefully no one goes through  the torture these guys give as they are completely miserable and rude when they speak.As far the phone goes its Exceptional phone just go for it,the best part of the phone is the Eye comfort feature that doesn't strain your  eyes while using the mobile for a long duration biggest drawback is face unlock its extremely slow and doesnt recognize the face at times.",1
4,After long waiting which phone to choose.. finally I chosen this mobile..which I feel  very glad to happy with me..the design is very superb and stylish..display.. excellent.camera perfect...sound is not excellent but it is very pleasant to listen and gud.. battery life also perfect..and processor speed superb...this is the review of using three days..u can afford it,0
4,"My previous phone was Honor 6 and it lasted for 4 years. So, I have made my mind to go only for Honor and Honor8x this time. This was a excellent buy, as I gave my honor6 for 3k.Coming to the review.Pros:1. Excellent battery life2. Unbeatable performance - Kirin 710 worked liked charm.3. No lagging or heating issues.4. If you are used to EMUI, then you won't be disappointed with the user interface. It was got lot of user friendly customizations.5. Excellent design6. Awesome quality - You can go through you tube videos to check the durability test.Cons:1.A bit heavy phone - due to the battery size.2. Camera performance can still be improved, even though 3D lights OTA has been pushed recently.",0
5,Superb large displey and excellent bettrey life with super fast 12nm based kirin 710 soc chip set very thank full to honor india for making such great product for chip price & thanks to amazon for great discount offer during diwali sale. Must buy this excellent all rounder product,0
4,"Face unlock does not work properly (you need to keep the phone at different dimensions/up & down to unlock). Speaker sound quality for songs is average (I am comparing it with Lenovo K6 Power which has Dolby sound). Picture quality is good among chinese phones. All latest features viz. photo by waving hand, penaorama etc are available. Speed is good in comparison to my Motorola E5+ phone (which hangs and is slow). Battery life is good for a days work. I am satisfied overall and find it as per my expectations (I have not used Oneplus / Iphone / other high end phones so far).",1
4,"the fone in one word can be called BEAUTY, battery touch large lovely display and everything about the phone is perfect but it is sad to say that there is no parallel space(dual space in miui),,strnge to find that it was present in earlier version of honor phones but strangely being such a strong fone with 4gb memory n kirin 710, the parallel space is missing,,,,i hope they bring it ASAP WITH AN OTA UPDATE ,,REST ALL IS GREAT",0
5,"I've been using this for about 1 month and here are my thoughts....Design- stunning, one of the best looking phonesDisplay- Really good, best for watching moviesSoftware- Emui is pretty smooth, has a lot of customisation, the icons are a bit large but otherwise goodPerformance-CPU performance is one of the best....all apps open pretty fast, ram management is decent....GPU is okay- when i played pes 2019, there was some minor lag even on standard settings...I think this is due to poor optimisation and they can fix it with an updateCamera- Above average.....Not the best pics but certainly usable, could have added eis in videos though....Battery- Very goodMy usage- 1.5hr gaming, 1hr youtube videos, 0.5hr music playback, 1 hr web surfing.....with this usage the battery can last upto 1.5 days....Cons-no eis in videosgaming could have been betterglass back can break easilyno bootloader unlockingslow updatesspeaker volume is a bit lowOverall its a solid phone, which does excel in anything, but also does not fall short on any category...",1
5,"I am really very happy with this phone.Best phone in this budget.Best for Game playing, specially like PUBG. Very smooth Gaming. Operating fast as expected. Battery life is also good.

Software:- in this department huawei  stand out in competition5. Camera back 9/10, front 7/106. Battery 10/107. Gaming:- I played all of this game in my 8x Pubg, Asphalt, NFS most wanted 2012, Virtua Tennis and I found no problems.8. No hitting issue in Honor 8x because Kirin 710 & 6gb ram runs can every things Smoothly .9. And AI system which is best part of Honor 8x its fantastic feature.",1
5,"Honor just break the market of smartphone with this phone after over 5months of use i comes to know that :-Performance of this phone is totally mind blowing.Management of Ram is awsome.Split screen helps you to do two work at the same time with best performance.Battery consumption is managed by Artificial intelligence so gives you 2 or 2.5 day battery backup for normal use and 1.5 day backup for pro users and almost 1days batt backup for gaming users.Display quality is awsome notch is perfectly shaped.Face unlock and finger unlock is works perfectly and fast.Now if i am talking about camera so the camera quality is too much good in comparison with samsung, Mi, Vivo, oppo you got many functions like AI mode AR sticker 3D lighting mode Portrait mode.As well as this device will going to update with the newest Emui 9 based on Android pie in this update we will getting many new changes like OIS, EIS.Worthy phoneRecommended to buy.",1
5,"I have been using this device for over a month now.Best battery life is amazing due to 12nm kirin 710 chip. unlike 14nm snapdragon budget chips which consume more battery.Very Good camera performance. Night Sight is good as well, works nice under minimal lighting conditions.Gaming is great... no lag playing pubg. Can play on HD as well.Speakers are good. and there are ton of options for tweaking sound while uisng earphones. Good Sound.Display is vivid. And there is build in eye protection as well.Overall a great product. Well balanced specs. You wont feel anything missing for 15000rs.Great Value for money.",1
4,"Today I got this phone on time as mentioned by Amazon... Thank you Amazon... Coming to phone, I'm sure you will fall in love with this phone due to its build quality, frame...excellent display feel... No laging while switching apps, playing games, etc..Camera:I feel camera is not too good and not too bad... Overall it is fine... Both front and back..I recommend to buy honor 8x..",0
4,"Battery Back up is too good. 02 Days  is more than enough after using apps, Data,videos etc. Camera quality and phone overall user interface is friendly. Only while Buying this product during payment through credit card EMI BEWARE!!!!at Last step of payment on Top left side window it will show total amount as in my case 16198 will be deducted during initial payment and after 7-8 days the amount will be credited to the account and EMI will be charged. But i was amazed when inquired to customer service that 16198 amount will not be credited since it remains block until you pay all the amount in EMI & as and when u pay monthly EMI that will be credited to my account. Unnecessary now my credit card limit has been lowered.",0

5,"I had used redmi 3s prime, gionee a1 and now honor 8x.really its great. I am fully satisfied. Earlier mobiles i noticed some problems like battery heating,security issues in redmi, gionee.But totally shocking by using honor 8x.i am the owner from 6months.yet didn't deal any problem. I almost get 5-6 updates.now using android 9.0.nice. Giving 5star.but need to upgrade camera.keep it up.",0
5,It truly defines the word smartphone.Used lots of phone including Iphone but this is something else.*The display is so good that rainbow will flow from your eyes.Only thing missing is fast charging and usb type c.( but not a major issue) because the battery life is too good.(5 hours of pubg in full brightness and ultra settings only 25% battery reduced).Without any third thought go have this beauty and the beast.,0
5,"Best in this price segment.Pros :Battery backup is Great. 2-3 hours of youtube, 1-2 hours of social media, 2-3 hours of pubg and other usual work on an off day and still you will have 25-30% juice left.Gaming Turbo mode is awesome. Doesn't heat up even on heavy gaming.Display is crisp.Dedicated memory card slot.And it look's Awesome.Cons :Camera isn't best but will get you Above Average shots n' clips.No Type-C port.No fast charging (Thats okay considering price point.)A little too big in size to handle but eventually you will get used to it.",1
5,Fabulous product... Total value for money... The screen size is stunning yet the phone feels light and easy to handle.... Runs smoothly without any lag even when running multiple apps esp. games....Battery life is also good....A must buy at this price range. Would have been a stunner in this category if it also had the image stabilisation option.,0
4,"I brought this phone on November 2018, now it been 5 months, the hardware of the phone, no doubt at all, really nice and beautiful,But!!!!!!!The software really sucks, there is separete mail account on hawai and Iinked  my Gmail account with hawai and later I disconnect it, after that all my contact numbers were deleted, photos and document were disappeared, and more over eveytime when I m on coversation, I can't hear it properly and it like movie where you phone calls are block by some one els, some strange voice coming and after that call ends by it self.I never faced these kind of problems,I heard a news that hawai CEO was detained by US government, about spying,Now I am really on doubt.",0
5,"I was very cautious while placing order for mobile as I had very bad experience of buying mobile online. But I must say this time I got lucky. The phone is amazing in terms of looks, battery, sound quality etc. Picture quality is not the best but also not the worst. All in all I am really happy with this purchase. Thanks honor for this wonderful phone and Amazon service is very much appreciatable 🤘👍",1
4,1. 4K Recording2. EIS as it has Gyroscope Sensor3. Improvement in both cameras as it  oversaturate the pictures4. Portrait Mode of front camera needs  improvement as it smudge the edges of  the object which is to be captured5. Fast Charging as Kirin 710 supports Fast  ChargingPS:- I hope so above mentioned points are  implemented through next OTA update.,0
5,Really surprised by this phone. I am a honor fan previously used honor 4X then 6X and now owning 8X. In this price range nothing can beat this phone. Big display having excellent picture quality. Really interesting for watching movie in full screen mode with notch. Fast processr. Camera quality is way better. But absence of eis in video capturing disappointing me. Its not a problem. Battery backup is fantastic. It will last for one full day with heavy use and 12hrs of screenon timing and browsing youtube movie watching shoping sites etc etc.... Budget phone at this price. Trust me it wont let u down.,0
5,Well I like tge delivery process nd it was right on time awesome smartphone with smart features If you were gonna buy this so yiu should have to definitely buy this phone camera quality is also very goood battery lyf is ohk display quality is freaking awesome sound is also good but you can't get  earphones in the box you have to buy it from store but all over performance wise this is a ई excellent phone,0
5,best phone in mid rangeexcellent processorboth cameras are excellentvery good performancesdisplay is excellent....... This phone is very suitable for athletes because of 480 frames. The design of the phone is very modern and beautiful.,1
4,Almost Everything is perfect.. One of the best in the segment.. Review after usage for 15 days..+ Doesn't support fast charge but still it boost up bit quickly.. Battery backup is also good..+ Night mode is really good best under 20k..+ Day light pictures are above average..+ Display and thin bezels..+ Design..+ Build quality..+ PerformanceBelow are the areas that could have made phone as the only best in segment..-OIS is not there-Secondary camera should have been at least 5mpOverall if you are a video shooter and likes to do on a regular basis then this is not the phone for u as there is no OIS.. Otherwise its the best..,1
5,I purchased Red colour. It looks amazing. If anyone wants to buy red colour please buy it you will not regret. Camera are also amazing very good quality. Baterry backup is also excellent. I think this is the best phone under 15k. Firstly i have confusion that i would buy asus zenfone max pro m2 or realme 2 pro or honor 8x. And now i was really impressed by this product,1
4,"Pretty good smartphone for its price range, gives quite a long battery backup but the camera is one of its cons it takes pretty average pictures and concerning gaming there hasn't been any heating issues but the frame rate drops by a tiny bit when playing pubg at high frame rate and HD settings but other graphic intensive games like asphault 9 runs smoothly if your budget is under 15k then go for it in my opinion",0
5,"Still baffled that how come this masterpiece is available at just for 15k. It's just simply amazing. Can't take eyes of its display, it's so qmesmerizing, Huawei, heads down to you guys for producing such a quality fone at such a low price. You guys are truly brave. I am just awestruck!!",0
5,"Product is absolutely value for money. If you  don't use much data (minimal) for watching YouTube, games or movies, battery charged will last more than a day. But any phone drains if you use more data continuously.",0
4,"1st of all Design and build quality is superb no other mobile in this price range gives u tht premium feel. Fingerprint and face unlock works fast. Picture quality good.. Sound quality is also OK if they could hv provided 3.55 mm jack in the top section, it would hv been better and they could hv put double speakers at the bottom. Battery drains quickly if u play games otherwise full day backup wid moderate use.honor has provided elevated camera which I don't like, should b inbuilt. If u put back cover then all show goes away.  Overall good experience wid honor and I hope camera gets better wid new sw update as it oversaturates",0
4,"1. Looks are great like a flagship.2. Battery and overall performance is good.3. Camera is low point because it captures artificial colours or pumped up colours, no EIS, no 4k, selfies are good, night mode works well.4. Dispay is awesome.5. Touch and feel is great.6. Sound is clear but not the loudest.7. EMUI updates are not as fast as MIUI.8. EMUI is good but MIUI far better.Conclusion - If you are person who wants balanced, good looking, good performance and a phone that can capture good selfies Honor 8x is for you.But if you want a camera centric device don't buy it especially if you are a rear camera user or a video geek.",0
4,"GUYZ I m using honor 8x from almost 1 month and truly  saying the phone was fab. Even few of my friend who see this phone the also wants to buy because of his premium look but there are some drawbacks in it or we can say con like video stability, PPI, BACK CAMERA AND MORE and if honor didn't fix it than according to we have to move on to realme2 Pro because in last update the have almost fix All the cons of it like his front camera and they officially said they will provide slow motion video and many thing in there next update at January so if honor didn't fix all the CONS then I must recommend all to go on realme not just because of feature also because of price variance of 1000rs",0
5,"Build quality : Back is made of plastic and it's not glass.Picture quality : Only pixels doesn't matter. Picture quality is slightly above average.Sound quality : Clear and loud.Battery life : For moderate user, it can last for a day and in night you will have to charge. It doesn't support fast charging. It takes around 2 hours for full charge.",0
5,"First of all, Its a budget phone.Heavy performance, Good battery life, Good camera experience.single speaker only. but good sound. triple slot is a great advantage. Best under 15k. No type c. but thats ok in a budget phone. Most i liked was its design, feels like premium phone. 6.5 inch screen, but its nice to handle. Go for it.",1
5,i bought this phone for Rs12500 ..over all this product is goodin video EIS is missingdisplay has no gorilla glass productionthese 2 things r minus1st i planed to buy redmi note 5 pro but finally i bought Honor 8X with good dealIf u planed to buy Redmi note 5 u can blindly go for Honor 8X,1
5,"Recently bought this... Design wise, it's fabulous... Looks rich and classy. Battery life is amazing... It doesn't drain at all... At the end of the day, 35% charge is still remaining with normal usage of Google apps and YouTube. Picture quality is crisp and bokeh effect is amazing. The full screen feature locks all the videos perfectly",0
5,"Nice mobile and expected good package from the seller. Very much happy to use my honor mobile 1st time bought in amazon and with android pie 9.0.1 version they had updated after the oreo Android 8.0.1 version came to that mobile. Only one thing is missing is double tap to open the screen unlock feature, otherwise product iss good with kirin processor with AI camera features.",0
5,"Awesome glossy aluminium body, good battery backup, average charging speed, notch and bezel less display is too good, picture quality is good - but no 4k video and auto stabilising videos (would suggest to search in youtube how to stabilise video than your problem is solved for this issue) also the sound quality is average ( honor has done some cost cutting by putting an average speaker) but earphone/headphone sound output is good. Processor is excellent. Overall a good premium mobile phone.",0
4,What i didnt like1) sound quality with speakers is pathetic2) sound quality with mike needs lot of improvement3) youtube video quality sucks big time. I see grained vdos even at 480 pixel4) build quality doesnt feel rock solidYou can buy for big display and good camera qualityOverall 3/ 5,0
4,"Excellent phone... USB 3.0 missing...  Fast charging missing phone ui experience should have been little bit more smooth. Battery lasts for a day..... Camera is excellent... Speaker volume is also very  clear... Especially the earpiece.... It' very soothing to ears.... Wouldn't feel strain in ear even after the long call duration.... Though screen is monstrous 6.5 inches, it feels very handy... Back blue layout gives Premier feel... Very powerful processor, kirin 710... Excellent speed....",0
5,No one just can't find such a phone with these specs at this price. Overall a nice phone with speed and durability. Battery is superb and touch is also upto the mark.. Must go for it..,0
4,Pro's1.Good display2.Good battery life(1 to 1.5 days on heavy usage) (7 to 8 hrs of screen on time)3.Good rear camera4. No heating issues5.Excellent design and build qualityCon's1. Below average sound(only the volume is low..the quality is ok'ish)2. Average battery charging time(roughly around 2 to 2.5 hours)3. Average front facing camera(portrait has extra blurry effect)4. No idea about the glass protection)It's a good phone to buy in this price range.. You can go for it because it's a good looking device.,0
4,I like this mobile. It is a complete package. The sound quality is very good. Pictures are decent. Though the camera is weak in low light. Yet in daylight it clicks nice pictures. Battery is also good enough. Overall it's a good deal for moderate user.,0
4,Using from 2 month product is good. but there is 3 issues I found1. Phone hanging and not accepting call when slide to pick calls2. unwanted apps and browser opened automatically3. I can't sent contact in attachment because its always sent MMS by default when I attach any contact. there are no option to change mms to sms in setting in the phone.Overall Good.,0
5,"The camera takes a bit of mastering, but once you get the hang of it, it's a stunner! A budget phone, which can take near DSLR quality photo, a superb processor and 6 GB RAM to make gaming a breeze, and a premium look and feel, can't ask for more. Thank you, Huawei and Honor!",0
5,"beautiful phone.i thik best smartphone in 15000 price of range.kirin 710 processor is more faster then snapdragon 660.large and Crystal clear display,excillent battery backup in normal uses.sound quality is good.only one problem i face back camera is good but front camera is average.this phone is not for selfie lovers.honor 8x is better then real me 2pro.with any doubt go for it.",1
4,"this phone can be an excellent choice for normal usage as it has high specs, all the modern features like 6gb memory, face and fingerprint recognition at very affordable price. after using it for about 3 months, only downside I see is its battery which doesn't last more than 1 day",0
5,"I buy 5 December, delevry very fast ,,I love Amazon, I use one day, but back cover not matching in my mobile,,I decided return my mobile ,,,Display good,handset looking sexy😎😁but speaker sound low,, but calling speaker very loud 😅🔊🔊🔊📯📯I like calling speaker ummanh honor 8x , night time camera good working with light,,but back camera very poor night time ,,low flash light,, battery back up 1day high uses ,,normal use 1.5 day ,, value of money this mobile ..",0
5,A complete package within 15K.🖤Daylight picture quality is beyond imagination.Night mode does a good job. Make sure you set the camera at high resolution before clicking pictures. Display is comparable to any high end phone you can think of. Performance is pretty decent too.,0
4,Every one said that the phone doesn't have video call function. But simply the video call button is on the dial.And the sound is comparatively less. But not much less sound and the audio quality is amazing.Butbthe only problem is the battery life is not better with the other rage phone. But its lasting for one day surely.And pictures taken by the camera is good. Because of the new update.Screen quality is excellent.AND THEIR IS NO LAG OR ANYTHING THING LIKE THAT WHILE PLAYING PUBG MOBILE.ITSSS VERY SMOOTH FOR ME.,0
5,I gifted the mobile to my daughter on Diwali. It has been almost four months of use and she is extremely delighted with it. She has not been facing any issues and best part is that she has to charge it only once a day. She is quite active on social platforms and watches a lot of videos without headphones. The battery still lasts very long. The camera is decent and the picture quality very sharp. Nothing great about speakers but serves the purpose.,1
4,"Its huge display makes it look like a very premium phone(Navy Blue). Overall phone is decent for the price but still should have given fast charging though battery life is just truly awesome, cameras both front n back could have been better n I hope Honor, atleast gives a EIS update very soon. Plz honor provide double tap to lock n wake up device through update.",0
5,"Bought the phone the day it launched, using  more than 5 weeks. In one word excellent. Big clear display. Software smooth. Very good network reception. Finally battery, works for 1 and half day, forget power bank.I bought this exchanging Oppo f3, so paid around 9800. In this price it is the best someone can get.",1
4,Hi vewersI am not going complain more about phone.The only with the display features. There are host of display features in. But it doesn't give natural colors that is some what over saturated.And the main thing is when you are in auto brightness mode you can't able to set the minimum brightness level. Which may be the software bug.What I am saying to huawei or honor to fix this problem as soon as possible with the next update.One thing don't under estimate this phone the build and performance beast at this price level. BLINDLY GO FOR IT.,0
5,"1. Batary life good.2. Regular update of security patches3. Tough4.

5,Very excellent product with a stylish look and strengthy build qualityNo questions to the water resistance of the phone In such case my 8x is drown in water for about 4-5 times and still... Everything is cleanBy the way this review is written after 4 months of buying the honor 8xA clear phone in this budget is 8x,0
5,"You can't get the better value for under 18k. Great camera, stunning design, fabulous screen, sound quality is good too, gaming is on point, it doesn't heat up even on heavy gaming, build quality is great the only shit thing is it's user interface which you can bear with the pros. I wish it had Android 9 and type c port. Rest, go for it.",0
4,"I would say the most stylish phone ever I have hold so far. Excellend design- no comparison. I can't take my hands off to on serios nomte. Wide display but easily accessible. Software part is also excelent. 3 drawbacks. one is Camera. IT takes good images but looks like filters. Detailing missing, Second is Image stabilizer missing. video recording looks shaky. Third Battery life is average but it gets charged fast in 2 hours. And yeah, Speaker is average sometime i face difficulty in hearing but in this price- most stylish phone ever",0
5,"I purchased this device on 1st sale and after using this device for a week, I am very satisfied. Everything is just too good. The most amazing feature I like in this device is one can click a photo just by double-clicking the volume rocker button. I would recommend everyone considering the price at which this device is available.",0
5,"One of the best phones I ever had. It literally takes 50 - 55 mins to charge from 0 -100%. The phone is really fast and really smooth and light weighted to handle. Easy to carry around. The camera is fabulous and takes stunning shots even in a really fast-moving car. The fingerprint sensor and face recognition are good and fast. Fabulous phone, would surely recommend you to buy it.",1
5,Definitely it's a value for money device no doubt in that. Superb phonePros:1) Battery life2) Screen size and its quality3) slow motion recording4) Processor kirin 7105) Optimisation of osCons:1)In bokeh mode edge detection is not proper.,0
5,"Everything is ok but a little disappointed by not founding direct 4g video call . You can use third party video call ( whatsapp , google , FB ... Etc , )Otherwise Honor 8X is the best phone in 15K , thx to Honor company .After all blindly by this wonderful phone , I am happy to be a Honor costumer .",1
5,I bought it in amazon great india sale offer. The normal cost Rs17k. But with 10%discount on my debit card and by exchanging my old mobile i got under 14K. The mobile is worth for 17K. (64gb+6gb). Stylish and good at function. Iam writing this review after 5 months of purchase,0
4,First of all its a great value for money. As it is advertised its design is sleek and also its processor is very good. The processor keep the device very optimised most of the time. Its battery life is great. One full 100 percent can last you almost a day(including some heavy gaming and surfing).Its biggest con is the speaker. Its average at best. Its camera also sometimes click some over saturated pics but most of the time it gets the job done.At the end if you are looking for a sleek premium looking phone with allround performance and a tad bit compromising in the camera department this is the ideal phone for you.,1
5,"It's all over 3months+ and the phone was working perfectly, the battery was too good, no heat after playing PUBG mobile.Only I find that the camera was not good if you can zoom in then you will find that image will be a blur...I only like the front camera AI features is there.Overall it is a good phone with a lower budget which will get everything in it.",0
5,If you were using redmi.. Zenfone and other budget phones..this one will be your beast for you!!!You will really love this phone..Writing my review aftr 5 days:It has lot of hidden features..

Potarit mode is good but not great cause its edge detection. Pro mod is just superb.Display quality is good.colourful and crispy.Performance is good in daily uses. But when you playing pubg, its lagging sometime. Beacause of its Mali Gpu. Normal games running well, but if you are a gamer then its not for you.Overall 4 star out of 5.",1

5,This is my review after using this phone for 2 months.Pros -1. Stylish back side with glazing effect2. Camera quality is too good with AI provision on both cameras3. Battery life is really amazing that it lasts for 1.5 day easily on 4g network usage4. Runs smoothly without any lag for high end games like PUBG5. Asthetic and Ergonomics of the phone are way good for this kind of priceCons-1. Not suitable for music lovers. Sound quality is not good on headphones & on open also as it has only 1 speaker,0
5,"Low price, good specs. I bought this one just as something I would pass on to my siblings, after I bought the OnePlus 6T on launch. This phone is such a beauty, and smooth, I got second thoughts on buying OnePlus 6T. I think I'll buy another of this one instead.Movies, games, pics all are smooth.If you would want me to force out a con, it is just a little slippery mobile, so careful all glass. And would want that pattern lock back!",0
